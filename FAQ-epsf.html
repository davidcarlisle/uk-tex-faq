<h1><tt>epsf</tt> gives up after a bit</h1>


<p>

<p>
Some copies of the documentation of <i class="filename">epsf.tex</i> seemed once to
suggest that the command
<pre>
  \input epsf
</pre>
is needed for every figure included.  If you follow this suggestion
too literally, you get an error
<pre>
  ! No room for a new \read .
</pre>
after a while; this is because each time <i class="filename">epsf.tex</i> is loaded, it
allocates itself a <em>new</em> file-reading handle to check the figure
for its bounding box, and there just aren&rsquo;t enough of these things
(see <a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-noroom.html">no room for a new thing</a>).

<p>
The solution is simple&nbsp;&mdash; this is in fact an example of misuse of
macros; one only need read <i class="filename">epsf.tex</i> once, so change
<pre>
  ...
  \input epsf
  \epsffile{...}
  ...
  \input epsf
  \epsffile{...}
</pre>
(and so on) with a single
<pre>
  \input epsf
</pre>
somewhere near the start of your document, and then decorate your
<code>&#x5c;epsffile</code> statements with no more than adjustments of
<code>&#x5c;epsfxsize</code> and so on.
