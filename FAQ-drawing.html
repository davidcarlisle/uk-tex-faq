<p>

<p>
There are many packages to do pictures in (La)TeX itself (rather than
importing graphics created externally), ranging from simple use of
LaTeX <code class="environment">picture</code> environment, through enhancements like
<i class="progname">eepic</i>, to 
sophisticated (but slow) drawing with PicTeX. Depending on your type
of drawing, and setup, here are a few systems you may consider:
<ul>
<li> The <code class="environment">picture</code> environment provides rather primitive
  drawing capabilities (anything requiring more than linear
  calculations is excluded, unless a font can come to your help).  The
  environment&rsquo;s tedious insistence on its own <code>&#x5c;unitlength</code>, as the
  basic measurement in a diagram, may be avoided by use of the
  <i class="package">picture</i> package, which detects whether a length is quoted
  as a number or as a length, and acts accordingly.
<li> <i class="package">epic</i> was designed to make use of the LaTeX
  <code class="environment">picture</code> environment somewhat less agonising;
  <i class="package">eepic</i> extends it, and is capable of using <i class="progname">tpic</i>
  <code>&#x5c;special</code> commands to improve printing performance.  (If the
  <code>&#x5c;special</code>s aren&rsquo;t available, the <i class="package">eepicemu</i> will do the
  business, far less efficiently.
<li> <i class="package">pict2e</i>; this was advertised in 
  <a href="FAQ-latex-books.html">the LaTeX manual</a>, but didn&rsquo;t appear for nearly
  ten years after publication of the book!  It removes all the petty
  restrictions that surround the use of the <code class="environment">picture</code>
  environment.  It therefore suffers <em>only</em> from the rather
  eccentric drawing language of the environment, and is a far more
  useful tool than the original environment has ever been.  (Note that
  <i class="package">pict2e</i> supersedes David Carlisle&rsquo;s stop-gap
  <i class="package">pspicture</i>.)
<li> PicTeX is a venerable, and very powerful, system, that draws
  by placing dots on the page to give the effect of a line or curve.  While
  this has the potential of great power, it is (of course) much slower
  than any of the other established packages.  What&rsquo;s more, there
  are problems with its <a href="FAQ-docpictex.html">documentation</a>.
<li> <i class="package">PSTricks</i> gives you access to the (considerable) power of
  PostScript via a set of TeX macros, which talk to PostScript using 
  <a href="FAQ-specials.html"><code>&#x5c;special</code> commands</a>.  Since PostScript is itself a
  pretty powerful programming language, many astounding things can in
  principle be achieved using <i class="package">PSTricks</i> (a wide range of
  contributed packages, ranging from world mapping to lens design
  diagrams, is available).
  <i class="package">Pstricks</i>&rsquo; <code>&#x5c;special</code>s are
  by default specific to <i class="progname">dvips</i>, but there is
  a <i class="package">Pstricks</i> &lsquo;driver&rsquo; that allow <i class="package">Pstricks</i> to
  operate under XeTeX.  PDFTeX users may use <i class="package">pst-pdf</i>,
  which (like <i class="package">epstopdf</i>&nbsp;&mdash; see 
  <a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-pdftexgraphics.html">PDFLaTeX graphics</a>) generates
  PDF files using an auxiliary program, from <i class="package">PSTricks</i>
  commands (<i class="package">pst-pdf</i> also requires a recent installation of
  the <i class="package">preview</i> package).

<p>
  There is a <i class="package">PSTricks</i> mailing list
  (<a href="mailto:pstricks@tug.org">pstricks@tug.org</a>) which you may
  <a href="http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/pstricks">join</a>, or you may
  just browse the 
  <a href="http://tug.org/pipermail/pstricks/">list archives</a>.
<li> <i class="package">pgf</i>: while <i class="package">pstricks</i> is very powerful and
  convenient from &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; TeX, using it with PDFLaTeX is
  pretty tiresome: if you 
  simply want the graphical capabilities, <i class="package">pgf</i>, together with
  its &ldquo;user-oriented&rdquo; interface <i class="package">tikz</i>, may be a good
  bet for you.  While PDF has (in essence) the same graphical
  capabilities as PostScript, it isn&rsquo;t programmable; <i class="package">pgf</i> provides
  LaTeX commands that will utilise the graphical capabilities of
  both PostScript and PDF equally.  <i class="package">Pgf</i> has extensive
  mathematical support, which allows it to rival <i class="package">PSTricks</i>&rsquo;
  use of the computation engine within PostScript.
  The <i class="package">pgf</i> manual is enormous, but a simple introduction which
  allows the user to get a feel for the capabilities of the system, is
  available at <a href="http://cremeronline.com/LaTeX/minimaltikz.pdf">http://cremeronline.com/LaTeX/minimaltikz.pdf</a>
<li> MetaPost; you liked MetaFont, but never got to grips with font files?
  Try <a href="FAQ-MP.html">MetaPost</a>&nbsp;&mdash;
  all the power of MetaFont, but it generates PostScript figures; MetaPost
  is nowadays part of most serious (La)TeX distributions.  Knuth
  uses it for all his work&hellip;

<p>
  Note that you can 
  <a href="FAQ-inlgrphapp.html">&ldquo;embed&rdquo; MetaPost source in your document</a> (i.e.,
  keep it in-line with your LaTeX code).
<li> You liked MetaFont (or MetaPost), but find the language difficult?
  <i class="progname">Mfpic</i> makes up MetaFont or MetaPost code for you using
  familiar-looking (La)TeX macros.  Not <em>quite</em> the full power
  of MetaFont or MetaPost, but a friendlier interface, and with MetaPost output
  the results can be used equally well in either LaTeX or PDFLaTeX.
<li> You liked PicTeX but don&rsquo;t have enough memory or time?  Look
  at the late Eitan Gurari&rsquo;s <i class="package">dratex</i>: it is just as powerful,
  but is an entirely new implementation which is not as hard on
  memory, is much more readable and is (admittedly sparsely) documented at
  <a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/tpf/html/README.html">http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/&nbsp;gurari/tpf/html/README.html</a>,
  as well as in the author&rsquo;s book &ldquo;TeX and LATeX: Drawing and
  Literate Programming&rdquo;, which remains available from on-line
  booksellers.
</ul>

<p>
In addition, there are several means of generating code for your
graphics application (<i class="progname">asymptote</i>, <i class="progname">gnuplot</i> and
MetaPost, at least) in-line in your document, and then have them
processed in a command spawned from your (La)TeX run.  For details,
see <a href="FAQ-inlgrphapp.html">question</a>.
