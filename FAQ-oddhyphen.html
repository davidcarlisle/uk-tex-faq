You may have found that TeX&rsquo;s famed automatic word-division does
not produce the break-points recommended by your dictionary. This may be
because TeX is set up for American English, whose rules for word
division (as specified, for example, in Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary) are
completely different from the British ones (as specified, for example,
in the Oxford Dictionaries). This problem is being addressed by the UK
TeX User community (see Baskerville, issue&nbsp;4.4) but an entirely
satisfactory solution will take time; the current status is to be
found on CTAN (see

<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-newlang.html">&ldquo;using a new language&rdquo;</a> for instructions
on adding this new &ldquo;language&rdquo;).
