<h1>Page numbering by chapter</h1>


<p>

<p>
When I was a young man, a common arrangement for loose bound technical
manuals is to number pages by chapter.  (It&rsquo;s quite a good scheme, in
those situations: even if your corrections add a whole page to the
chapter, the most you have to redistribute is that chapter.)

<p>
The problem, at first sight, seems pretty much the same as that in
another answer on

<a href="FAQ-running-nos.html">running numbers within a chapter</a>,
and the basic technique is indeed pretty similar.

<p>
However, tidying-up loose ends, making sure the page number gets reset
to the correct value at the start of each chapter, and so on, is
slightly more challenging.  This is why the <i class="package">chappg</i> package
was written: it does the obvious things, and more.

<p>
Users have been known to ask for running page numbers within a
section, but this really doesn&rsquo;t make sense: you need to run page
numbers within document objects that always start on a fresh page.
