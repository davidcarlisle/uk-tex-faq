<p>

<p>
If you don&rsquo;t have access to the Internet, there are obvious
attractions to TeX collections on a disc.  Even those with net
access will find large quantities of TeX-related files to hand a
great convenience.

<p>
The TeX collection provides this, together with
ready-to-run TeX systems for various architectures.  The collection
is distributed on DVD, and contains:
<ul>
<li> The texlive distribution, including the programs themselves
  compiled for a variety of architectures; texlive may be
  run from the DVD or installed on hard disc.
<li> MacTeX: an easy to install TeX system for MacOS/X, based
  on texlive; this distribution includes a native Mac installer,
  
  <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/.html">the TeXShop front-end</a>
  and other Mac-specific tools;
<li> ProTeXt: an easy to install TeX system for Windows, based
  on MiKTeX, based on an &lsquo;active&rsquo; document that guides
  installation; and
<li> A snapshot of CTAN.
</ul>
A fair number of national TeX User Groups, as well as TUG,
distribute copies to their members at no extra charge.  Some user
groups are also able to sell additional copies:
contact your local user group or <a href="FAQ-TUG*.html">TUG</a>.

<p>
You may also download disc images from CTAN; the installation
disc, ProTeXt and MacTeX are all separately available.  Beware:
they are all pretty large downloads.  texlive, once installed, may
be updated online.

<p>
More details of the collection are available from

  <a href="http://www.tug.org/texcollection/.html">its own web page</a>
  on the TUG site.
