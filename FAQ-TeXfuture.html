<h1>What is the future of TeX?</h1>


<p>

<p>
Knuth has declared that he will do no further development of TeX;
he will continue to fix any bugs that are reported to him (though
bugs are rare).  This decision was made soon after
TeX version&nbsp;3.0 was released; at each bug-fix release
the version number acquires one more digit, so that it tends to the
limit&nbsp;&pi; (at the time of writing, Knuth&rsquo;s latest release
is version 3.1415926).  Knuth wants TeX to be frozen at
version&nbsp;&pi; when he dies; thereafter, no further changes
may be made to Knuth&rsquo;s source.  (A similar rule is applied to MetaFont;
its version number tends to the limit&nbsp;<em>e</em>, and currently
stands at 2.718281.)

<p>
Knuth explains his decision, and exhorts us all to respect it, in a
paper originally published in 
<a href="http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb11-4/tb30knut.pdf">TUGboat 11(4)</a>,
and reprinted in the 
<a href="http://www.ntg.nl/maps/pdf/5_34.pdf">NTG journal MAPS</a>.

<p>
There are projects (some of them long-term
projects: see, for example,
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-LaTeX3.html">the LaTeX3 project</a>)

to build substantial new macro packages based on TeX.  There are
also various projects to build a <em>successor</em> to TeX.  The
<a href="FAQ-etex.html">e-TeX</a> extension to TeX itself arose from such a
project (NTS).  Another pair of projects, which have delivered
all the results they are likely to deliver, is the
related 
<a href="FAQ-omegaleph.html">Omega and Aleph</a>.  The 
<a href="FAQ-xetex.html">XeTeX system</a> is in principle still under
development, but is widely used, and the 
<a href="FAQ-luatex.html">LuaTeX project</a> (though not scheduled to produce
for some time) has already delivered a system that increasingly
accessible to &ldquo;ordinary users&rdquo;.
