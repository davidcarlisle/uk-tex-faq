<h1>How should I pronounce &ldquo;LaTeX([[[twee]]][[[LBRACE]]][[[RBRACE]]])&rdquo;?</h1>


<p>

<p>
Lamport never recommended how one should pronounce LaTeX, but a lot
of people pronounce it &lsquo;Lay TeX&rsquo; or perhaps &lsquo;Lah TeX&rsquo; (with
TeX pronounced as the program itself; see
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-TeXpronounce.html">the rules for TeX</a>).  It is definitely
<em>not</em> to be pronounced in the same way as the rubber-tree gum
(which would be &lsquo;lay teks&rsquo;).

<p>
The LaTeX 2e logo is supposed to end with an
&amp;epsilon;; nevertheless, most
people pronounce the name as &lsquo;LaTeX-two-ee&rsquo;.
