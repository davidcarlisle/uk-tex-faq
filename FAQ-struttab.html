<h1>Spacing lines in tables</h1>


<p>

<p>
(La)TeX mechanisms for maintaining the space between lines (the
&ldquo;<em>leading</em>&rdquo;) rely on TeX&rsquo;s paragraph builder, which compares
the shape of consecutive lines and adjusts the space between them.

<p>
These mechanisms can&rsquo;t work in exactly the same way when (La)TeX is
building a table, because the paragraph builder doesn&rsquo;t get to see the
lines themselves.  As a result, tables sometimes typeset with lines
uncomfortably close together (or occasionally ridiculously far apart).

<p>
Traditional (moving metal type) typographers would adjust the spacing
between lines of a table by use of a &ldquo;<em>strut</em>&rdquo; (a metal
spacer).  A TeX user can do exactly the same thing: most macro
packages define a <code>&#x5c;strut</code> command, that defines a space appropriate
to the current size of the text; placing a <code>&#x5c;strut</code> command at the
end of a troublesome row is the simplest solution to the problem&nbsp;&mdash;
if it works.  Other solutions below are LaTeX-specific, but some
may be simply translated to Plain TeX commands.

<p>
If your table exhibits a systematic problem (i.e., every row is wrong
by the same amount) use <code>&#x5c;extrarowheight</code>, which is defined by the
<i class="package">array</i> package:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage{array}% in the preamble
...
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{length}
\begin{tabular}{....}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
To correct a single row whose maladjustment isn&rsquo;t corrected by a
<code>&#x5c;strut</code> command, you can define your own, using
<code>&#x5c;rule</code><code>&#x7b;0pt&#x7d;</code></code><code>&#x7b;length&#x7d;</code>&nbsp;&mdash; which is a near approximation to the
command that goes inside a <code>&#x5c;strut</code>.  The <i class="package">bigstrut</i> package
defines a strut command that you can use for this purpose:
<code>&#x5c;bigstrut</code> on its own opens up both above and below the current
line; <code>&#x5c;bigstrut</code><code>[t]</code> opens up above the line,
<code>&#x5c;bigstrut</code><code>[b]</code> opens up below the line.

<p>
General solutions are available, however.  The <i class="package">tabls</i> package
automatically generates an appropriately-sized strut at the end of
each row.  Its disadvantages are that it&rsquo;s really rather slow in
operation (since it gets in the way of everything within tables) and
its (lack of) compatibility with other packages.

<p>
The <i class="package">makecell</i> package provides a command <code>&#x5c;gape</code> that may
be used to apply strut expansion for a single cell of a table:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  ... &amp; \gape{cell contents} &amp; ... \\
  ...
\end{tabular}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The package&rsquo;s similar <code>&#x5c;Gape</code> command provides the same function,
but with optional arguments that allow you to adjust the top and
bottom adjustment.

<p>
To adjust every cell in whole tables, the
<code>&#x5c;setcellgapes</code><code>&#x7b;&lsaquo;<i>value</i>&rsaquo;&#x7d;</code> sets the adjustment value (an
optional argument of &ldquo;<tt>t</tt>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<tt>b</tt>&rdquo; restricts
adjustment to the top or bottom of each cell, respectively).  Having
issued <code>&#x5c;setcellgapes</code>, the command <code>&#x5c;makegapedcells</code> switches
cell expansion on, and <code>&#x5c;nomakegapedcells</code> switches it off again.

<p>
The <i class="package">cellspace</i> package does a (possibly inferior) job by
defining a new table/array column type &ldquo;S&rdquo;, which you apply to each
column specification.  So, for example,
<blockquote>
<code>&#x5c;begin</code><code>&#x7b;tabular&#x7d;</code></code><code>&#x7b;l l l p&#x7b;3cm&#x7d;&#x7d;</code>
</blockquote>
would become
<blockquote>
<code>&#x5c;begin</code><code>&#x7b;tabular&#x7d;</code></code><code>&#x7b;Sl Sl Sl Sp&#x7b;3cm&#x7d;&#x7d;</code>
</blockquote>
and so on.  This technique shows
promise of not interfering so much with other packages, but this
author has heard of no reports from the field.

<p>
The <i class="package">booktabs</i> package comes with a thought-provoking essay
about how tables should be designed.  Since table row-spacing problems
most often appear in collisions with rules, the author&rsquo;s thesis,
that LaTeX users tend too often to rule their tables, is
interesting.  The package provides rule commands to support the
author&rsquo;s scheme, but deals with inter-row spacing too.  The most
recent release of <i class="package">booktabs</i> sports compatibility with
packages such as <i class="package">longtable</i>.
