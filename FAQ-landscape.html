<h1>Typesetting things in landscape orientation</h1>


<p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s often necessary to typeset part of a document in landscape
orientation; to achieve this, one needs not only to change the page
dimensions, but also to instruct the output device to print the
strange page differently.

<p>
There are two &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; mechanisms for doing two slight variations
of landscape typesetting:
<ul>
<li> If you have a single floating object that is wider than it is
  deep, and will only fit on the page in landscape orientation, use
  the <i class="package">rotating</i> package; this defines
  <code class="environment">sidewaysfigure</code> and <code class="environment">sidewaystable</code>
  environments which create floats that occupy a whole page.

<p>
  Note that <i class="package">rotating</i> has problems in a document that also
  loads the <i class="package">float</i> package, which recommended in other
  answers in these FAQs, for example that on
  <a href="FAQ-floats.html">float placement</a>.  The <i class="package">rotfloat</i> package
  loads <i class="package">rotating</i> for you, and smooths the interaction with
  <i class="package">float</i>.
<li> If you have a long sequence of things that need to be typeset in
  landscape (perhaps a code listing, a wide <code class="environment">tabbing</code>
  environment, or a huge table typeset using <i class="package">longtable</i> or
  <i class="package">supertabular</i>), use the <i class="package">lscape</i> package (or
  <i class="package">pdflscape</i> if you&rsquo;re generating PDF output, whether
  using PDFLaTeX or <i class="progname">dvips</i> and generating PDF from
  that).  Both packages define an environment <code class="environment">landscape</code>, which
  clears the current page and restarts typesetting in landscape
  orientation (and clears the page at the end of the environment
  before returning to portrait orientation).
</ul>
No currently available package makes direct provision for typesetting
in both portrait and landscape orientation on the same page (it&rsquo;s not
the sort of thing that TeX is well set-up to do).  If such
behaviour was an absolute necessity, one might use the techniques
described in

<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-textflow.html">"flowing text around figures"</a>, and would
rotate the landscape portion using the rotation facilities of the
<i class="package">graphics</i> package.  (Returning from landscape to portrait
orientation would be somewhat easier: the portrait part of the page
would be a bottom float at the end of the landscape section, with its
content rotated.)

<p>
To set an entire document in landscape orientation, one might use
<i class="package">lscape</i> around the whole document.  A better option is the
<code class="pkgoption">landscape</code> option of the <i class="package">geometry</i> package; if you
also give it <code class="pkgoption">dvips</code> or <code class="pkgoption">pdftex</code> option,
<i class="package">geometry</i> also emits the rotation instructions to cause the
output to be properly oriented.  The <i class="class">memoir</i> class has the same
facilities, in this respect, as does <i class="package">geometry</i>.

<p>
A word of warning: most current TeX previewers do not honour
rotation requests in DVI files.













Your best bet is to convert your output to PostScript or to PDF, and
to view these &lsquo;final&rsquo; forms with an appropriate viewer.
