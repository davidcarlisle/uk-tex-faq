<h1>How to ask a question</h1>


<p>

<p>
You want help from the community at large; you&rsquo;ve decided where you&rsquo;re
going to <a href="FAQ-gethelp.html">ask your question</a>, but how do you
phrase it?

<p>
Excellent &ldquo;general&rdquo; advice (how to ask questions of anyone) is
contained in

<a href="http://catb.org/&nbsp;esr/faqs/smart-questions.html.html">Eric Raymond&rsquo;s article on the topic</a>.
Eric&rsquo;s an extremely self-confident person, and this comes through in
his advice; but his guidelines are very good, even for us in the
un-self-confident majority.  It&rsquo;s important to remember that you don&rsquo;t
have a right to advice from the world, but that if you express
yourself well, you will usually find someone who will be pleased to
help.

<p>
So how do you express yourself in the (La)TeX world?  There aren&rsquo;t
any comprehensive rules, but a few guidelines may help in the
application of your own common sense.
<ul>
<li> Make sure you&rsquo;re asking the right people.  Don&rsquo;t ask in a TeX
  forum about printer device drivers for the <i class="progname">Foobar</i>
  operating system.  Yes, TeX users need printers, but no, TeX
  users will typically <em>not</em> be <i class="progname">Foobar</i> systems
  managers.

<p>
  Similarly, avoid posing a question in a language that the majority
  of the group don&rsquo;t use: post in Ruritanian to
  <i class="newsgroup">de.comp.text.tex</i> and you may have a long wait before a
  German- and Ruritanian-speaking TeX expert notices your
  question.
<li> If your question is (or may be) TeX-system-specific, report
  what system you&rsquo;re using, or intend to use: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t install
  TeX&rdquo; is as good as useless, whereas &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to install the
  <i class="progname">mumbleTeX</i> distribution on the <i class="progname">Grobble</i>
  operating system&rdquo; gives all the context a potential respondent
  might need.  Another common situation where this information is
  important is when you&rsquo;re having trouble installing something new in
  your system: &ldquo;I want to add the <i class="package">glugtheory</i> package to my
  <i class="progname">mumbleTeX v12.0</i> distribution on the <i class="progname">Grobble 2024</i>
  operating system&rdquo;.
<li> If you need to know how to do something, make clear what your
  environment is: &ldquo;I want to do <em>x</em> in Plain TeX&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I
  want to do <em>y</em> in LaTeX running the <i class="class">boggle</i>
  class&rdquo;.  If you thought you knew how, but your attempts are
  failing, tell us what you&rsquo;ve tried: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already tried installing
  the <i class="package">elephant</i> in the <i class="package">minicar</i> directory, and it
  didn&rsquo;t work, even after refreshing the filename database&rdquo;.
<li> If something&rsquo;s going wrong within (La)TeX, pretend you&rsquo;re
  <a href="FAQ-latexbug.html">submitting a LaTeX bug report</a>,
  and try to generate a <a href="FAQ-minxampl.html">minimum failing example</a>.
  If your example 
  needs your local <i class="class">xyzthesis</i> class, or some other resource
  not generally available, be sure to include a pointer to how the
  resource can be obtained.
<li> Figures are special, of course.  Sometimes the figure itself is
  <em>really</em> needed, but most problems may be demonstrated with a
  &ldquo;figure substitute&rdquo; in the form of a
  <code>&#x5c;rule</code><code>&#x7b;width&#x7d;</code></code><code>&#x7b;height&#x7d;</code> command, for some value of
  &lsaquo;<i>width</i>&rsaquo; and &lsaquo;<i>height</i>&rsaquo;.  If the (real) figure is needed,
  don&rsquo;t try posting it: far better to put it on the web somewhere.
<li> Be as succinct as possible.  Your helpers don&rsquo;t usually need to
  know <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re doing something, just <em>what</em> you&rsquo;re
  doing and where the problem is.
</ul>
