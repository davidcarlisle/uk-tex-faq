<h1>The comma as a decimal separator</h1>


<p>

<p>
TeX embodies the British/American cultural convention of using a
period as the separator between the whole number and the decimal
fraction part of a decimal number.  Other cultures use a comma as
separator, but if you use a comma in maths mode you get a small space
after it; this space makes a comma that is used as a decimal separator
look untidy.

<p>
A simple solution to this problem, in maths mode, is to type
<tt>3</tt>&#x7b;,&#x7d;<tt>14</tt> in place of <tt>3,14</tt>.  While such a
technique may produce the right results, it is plainly not a
comfortable way to undertake any but the most trivial amounts of
typing numbers.

<p>
Therefore, if you need to use commas as decimal separator, you will
probably welcome macro support.  There are two packages that
can help relieve the tedium: <i class="package">icomma</i> and <i class="package">ziffer</i>.

<p>
<i class="package">Icomma</i> ensures that there will be no extra space after a
comma, unless you type a space after it (as in <tt>f(x, y)</tt>&nbsp;&mdash; in
the absence of the package, you don&rsquo;t need that space), in which case
the usual small space after the comma appears.  <i class="package">Ziffer</i> is
specifically targeted at the needs of those typesetting German, but
covers the present need, as well as providing the double-minus sign
used in German (and other languages) for the empty &lsquo;cents&rsquo; part of an
amount of currency.

<p>
The <i class="package">numprint</i> package provides a command
<code>&#x5c;numprint</code><code>&#x7b;number&#x7d;</code> that prints its argument according to
settings you give it, or according to settings chosen to match the
language you have selected in <i class="package">babel</i>.  The formatting works
equally well in text or maths.  The command is very flexible (it can also
group the digits of very &lsquo;long&rsquo; numbers), but is inevitably less
convenient than <i class="package">icomma</i> or <i class="package">ziffer</i> if you are typing a
lot of numbers.
