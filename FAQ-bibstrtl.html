<h1>&lsquo;String too long&rsquo; in BibTeX</h1>


<p>

<p>
The BibTeX diagnostic &ldquo;Warning&ndash;you&rsquo;ve exceeded 1000, the
<tt>global-string-size</tt>, for entry <tt>foo</tt>&rdquo; usually arises
from a very large abstract or annotation included in the database.
The diagnostic usually arises because of an infelicity in the coding of
<i class="filename">abstract.bst</i>, or styles derived from it.  (One doesn&rsquo;t
ordinarily output annotations in other styles.)

<p>
The solution is to make a copy of the style file (or get a clean copy
from CTAN&nbsp;&mdash; <a class="ctan" href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/abstract-bst">abstract-bst</a>), and rename it (e.g., on a
long file-name system, to <i class="filename">abstract-long.bst</i>).  Now edit it: find
function <tt>output.nonnull</tt> and
<ul>
<li> change its first line (line 60 in the version on CTAN)
  from
<blockquote>
<pre>
{ 's :=
</pre>
</blockquote>
to
<blockquote>
<pre>
{ swap$
</pre>
</blockquote>
Finally,
<li> delete the function&rsquo;s last line, which just says &ldquo;<tt>s</tt>
  (line 84 in the version on CTAN).
</ul>
Finally, change your <code>&#x5c;bibliographystyle</code> command to refer to the
name of the new file.

<p>
This technique applies equally to any bibliography style: the same
change can be made to any similar <tt>output.nonnull</tt> function.

<p>
If you&rsquo;re reluctant to make this sort of change, the only way forward
is to take the entry out of the database, so that you don&rsquo;t encounter
BibTeX&rsquo;s limit, but you may need to retain the entry because it
will be included in the typeset document.  In such cases, put the body
of the entry in a separate file:
<blockquote>
<pre>
@article{long.boring,
  author =    "Fred Verbose",
  ...
  abstract =  "{\input{abstracts/long.tex}}"
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
In this way, you arrange that all BibTeX has to deal with is the
file name, though it will tell TeX (when appropriate) to include
all the long text.
