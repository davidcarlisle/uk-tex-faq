There has been a TeX User Group since very near the time TeX
first appeared.  That first group, TUG, is still active and its
journal <i class="slanted">TUGboat</i> continues in regular publication

document design, processing and production.  TUG holds a yearly
conference, whose proceedings are published in <i class="slanted">TUGboat</i>.

TUG&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.tug.org.html">web site</a> is a valuable
resource for all sorts of
