<p>

<p>
People have long argued for (La)TeX books to be made available on
the web, and until relatively recently this demand went un-answered.

<p>
The first to appear was Victor Eijkhout&rsquo;s excellent &ldquo;TeX by
Topic&rdquo; in 2001 (it had been published by Addison-Wesley, but was long
out of print).  The book is now available on CTAN; it&rsquo;s not a
beginner&rsquo;s tutorial but it&rsquo;s a fine reference.  It&rsquo;s also available,
as a printed copy, via the on-line publishers
<a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/2555607/.html">Lulu</a> (not quite free, of
course, but not a <em>bad</em> deal&hellip;).

<p>
Addison-Wesley have also released the copyright of &ldquo;TeX for the
Impatient&rdquo; by Paul W.&nbsp;Abrahams, Karl Berry and Kathryn A.&nbsp;Hargreaves,
another book whose unavailability many have lamented.  The authors
have re-released the book under the GNU Free Documentation
Licence, and it is available from CTAN.

<p>
Norm Walsh&rsquo;s &ldquo;Making TeX Work&rdquo; (originally published by O&rsquo;Reilly)
is also available (free) on the Web, at
<a href="http://makingtexwork.sourceforge.net/mtw/.html">http://makingtexwork.sourceforge.net/mtw/</a>; the sources of the
Web page are on CTAN.  The book was an excellent resource in
its day, but while it is now somewhat dated, it still has its uses,
and is a welcome addition to the list of on-line resources.  A project
to update it is believed to be under way.
