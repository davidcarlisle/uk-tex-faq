# The UK TeX FAQ

## Origins and maintenance

This FAQ was started as a committee effort by the
[UK TeX Users' Group](http://uk.tug.org/). For many years it was maintained
by Robin Fairbairns. It is now a community-driven effort but still co-ordinated
by the UK-TUG group.

If you wish to offer help, or to comment on the content of the FAQ,
please mail [faq@tex.ac.uk](mailto:faq@tex.ac.uk) or log an issue
on the [source GitHub site](https://github.com/uktug/uk-tex-faq).

## Licence

The source of the FAQ itself and its derived products (human-readable
versions presented as PDF and HTML) are released under the [Creative
Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
license.

You are permitted (nay, encouraged) to distribute the FAQ as widely as
you like.  Please be careful to keep your copy of the FAQ up-to-date:
it's possible to mirror the FAQ's directory on [CTAN](http://ctan.org),
or to watch the CTAN announcements mailing list (see the "answer" on
mailing lists in the FAQ itself).

Further, you are urged to be very careful about modifying the FAQ:

- the source and its relationship to the macros that support it, and
  to the dubious Perl scripts that create HTML versions, is extremely
  fragile; so changes are likely to be tricky to "get right".

- there's a positive danger in publishing un-reviewed advice,
  particularly if it claims to come from a usually reliable source.

Therefore, if you do have changes to make, please consider submitting
them to [faq@tex.ac.uk](mailto:faq@tex.ac.uk) at least in parallel with making
changes to your own copy.  A statement that details what you've done, in your
copy of the FAQ, is particularly useful.
