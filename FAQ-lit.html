<h1>What is Literate Programming?</h1>


<p>

<p>
Literate programming is the combination of documentation and source
together in a fashion suited for reading by human beings. 
In general, literate programs combine source
and documentation in a single file.  Literate programming tools then
parse the file to produce either readable documentation or compilable
source.  The WEB style of literate programming was created by
D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Knuth during the development of TeX.

<p>




  The &ldquo;<a href="FAQ-dtx.html">documented LaTeX</a>&rdquo; style of programming

is regarded by some as a form of literate programming, though it only
contains a subset of the constructs Knuth used.

<p>
Discussion of literate programming is conducted in the newsgroup
<i class="newsgroup">comp.programming.literate</i>, whose FAQ is stored on
CTAN.  Another good source of information is
