<h1>Using a new language with Babel</h1>


<p>

<p>
<i class="package">Babel</i> is capable of working with a large range of
languages, and a new user often wants to use a language that her
TeX installation is not set up to employ.  Simply asking Babel to
use the language, with the command
<pre>
  \usepackage[catalan]{babel}
</pre>
provokes the warning message

<pre>
Package babel Warning: No hyphenation patterns were loaded for
(babel)                the language `Catalan'
(babel)                I will use the patterns loaded for \language=0 instead.
</pre>


<pre>
Package babel Warning: No hyphenation patterns
                                 were loaded for
(babel)                the language `Catalan'
(babel)                I will use the patterns
                 loaded for \language=0 instead.
</pre>




<p>
The problem is that your TeX system doesn&rsquo;t know how to hyphenate
Catalan text: you need to tell it how before Babel can do its work
properly.  To do this, for LaTeX installations, one needs to change
<i class="filename">language.dat</i> (which is part of the Babel installation); it will
contain a line
<pre>
%catalan         cahyphen.tex
</pre>
which, if you remove the comment marker, is supposed to instruct
LaTeX to load Catalan hyphenation patterns when you tell it to build
a new format.

<p>
Unfortunately, in many Babel distributions, the line just isn&rsquo;t
right&nbsp;&mdash; you need to check the name of the file containing the
patterns you&rsquo;re going to use.  As you can see, in the author&rsquo;s system,
the name is supposed to be <i class="filename">cahyphen.tex</i>; however the file
actually present on the system is <i class="filename">cahyph.tex</i>&nbsp;&mdash; fortunately,
the error should prove little more than an inconvenience (most of the
files are in better distributions anyway, but an elusive one
may be found on CTAN; if you have to retrieve
a new file, ensure that it&rsquo;s correctly installed, for which see
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-inst-wlcf.html">installing a new package</a>).

<p>
Finally, you need to regenerate the formats used (in fact, most users
of Babel are using it in their LaTeX documents, so regenerating the
LaTeX-related formats will ordinarily be enough; however, the
author always generates the lot, regardless).
<dl>
<dt class="description">teTeX</dt><dd>It&rsquo;s possible to do the whole operation in one go, by
  using the <i class="progname">texconfig</i> command:
<pre>
texconfig hyphen latex
</pre>
  which first enters an editor for you to edit <i class="filename">language.dat</i>,
  and then regenerates the format you specify (<i class="progname">latex</i> in
  this case).

<p>
  Otherwise, to regenerate all formats, do: <br>
  <tt>fmtutil --all</tt>

<p>
  If you&rsquo;re willing to think through what you&rsquo;re doing (this is
  <em>not</em> for the faint-hearted), you can select a sequence of
  formats and for each one, run: <br>
  <tt>fmtutil --byfmt &lsaquo;<i>formatname</i>&rsaquo;</tt><br>
  where <em><tt>formatname</tt></em> is something like &lsquo;<tt>latex</tt>&rsquo;,
  or: <br>
  <tt>fmtutil --byhyphen &lsaquo;<i>hyphenfile</i>&rsaquo;</tt><br>
  where <em><tt>hyphenfile</tt></em> is the file specifying hyphenation
  to the format&nbsp;&mdash; usually <tt>language.dat</tt>
<dt class="description">MiKTeX</dt><dd> On a <i class="package">MiKTeX</i> distribution earlier than v2.0, do: <br>
  <tt>Start</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>Programs</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>MiKTeX</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>Maintenance</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>Create all format files</tt>


<p>
  or get a DOS window and run:<br>
  <tt>initexmf --dump</tt>

<p>
  On a <i class="package">MiKTeX</i> distribution v2.0 or later, the whole
  procedure can be done via the GUI.  To select the new
  language, do:<br>
  <tt>Start</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>Programs</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>MiKTeX 2</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>MiKTeX Options</tt>, and select the <tt>Languages</tt> tab.
  Select your language from the list, press the <tt>Apply</tt> button,
  and then the <tt>OK</tt> button.  Then select the <tt>General</tt>
  tab and press the <tt>Update Now</tt> button.

<p>
  Otherwise, edit the <i class="filename">language.dat</i> file (as outlined above),
  and then run:<br>
  <tt>initexmf --dump</tt><br>
  just as for a pre-v2.0 system.
</dl>

<p>
<b><em>Caveat</em>:</b> It is (just) possible that
your TeX system may run out of &ldquo;pattern memory&rdquo; while generating
the new format.  Most TeX implementations have fixed-size arrays
for storing the details of hyphenation patterns, but although their
size is adjustable in most modern distributions, actually changing the
size is a fiddle.  If you <em>do</em> find you&rsquo;ve run out of memory,
it may be worth scanning the list of languages in your
<i class="filename">language.dat</i> to see whether any could reasonably be removed.
