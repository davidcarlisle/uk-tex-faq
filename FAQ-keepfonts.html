<h1>Which font files should be kept</h1>


<p>

<p>
MetaFont produces from its run three files, a metrics (TFM) file, a
generic font (GF) file, and a log file; all of these files have the
same base name as does the input (<em>e.g.</em>, if the input file was
<i class="filename">cmr10.mf</i>, the outputs will be <i class="filename">cmr10.tfm</i>,
<i class="filename">cmr10.nnngf</i> (the file name may be mangled if you are using an
operating system which doesn&rsquo;t permit long file names)
and <i class="filename">cmr10.log</i>).

<p>
For TeX to use the font, you need a TFM file, so you need
to keep that.  However, you are likely to generate the same font
at more than one magnification, and each time you do so you&rsquo;ll
(incidentally) generate another TFM file; these files are
all the same, so you only need to keep one of them.

<p>
To preview or to produce printed output, the DVI processor will need a
font raster file; this is what the GF file provides.  However, while
there used (once upon a time) to be DVI processors that could use 
GF files, modern processors  use
packed raster (PK) files (incidentally, PDFTeX also uses
PK files if nothing &ldquo;better&rdquo; is available, but
see <a class="FA.html" href="FAQ-fuzzy-type3.html">fuzzy fonts in PDF</a>).
Therefore, you need to generate a PK file from the GF file; the
program <i class="progname">gftopk</i> does this for you, and once you&rsquo;ve done that you
may throw the GF file away.

<p>
The log file should never be needed again, unless there was some sort
of problem in the MetaFont run, and need not therefore be kept.
