There are certain things that <em>only</em> work in maths mode.  If your
document is not in maths mode and you have an <code class="verb">_</code> or a <code class="verb">^</code> character,
TeX (and by inheritance, LaTeX too) will say
<pre>
! Missing $ inserted
</pre>
as if you couldn&rsquo;t possibly have misunderstood the import of what you
were typing, and the only possible interpretation is that you had
committed a typo in failing to enter maths mode.  TeX, therefore,
tries to patch things up by inserting the <tt>&#x24;</tt> you &lsquo;forgot&rsquo;, so that
the maths-only object will work; as often as not this will land you in
further confusion.

<p>
It&rsquo;s not just the single-character maths sub- and superscript
operators: anything that&rsquo;s built in or declared as a maths operation,
from the simplest lower-case <code>&#x5c;alpha</code> through the inscrutable
<code>&#x5c;mathchoice</code> primitive, and beyond, will provoke the error if
misused in text mode.

<p>
LaTeX offers a command <code>&#x5c;ensuremath</code>, which will put you in maths
mode for the execution of its argument, if necessary: so if you want
an <code>&#x5c;alpha</code> in your running text, say
<code>&#x5c;ensuremath</code><code>&#x7b;<code>&#x5c;alpha</code>&#x7d;</code>; if the bit of running text somehow
transmutes into a bit of mathematics, the <code>&#x5c;ensuremath</code> will become
a no-op, so it&rsquo;s pretty much always safe.
