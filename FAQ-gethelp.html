<h1>Getting help online</h1>


<p>

<p>
We assume, here, that you have looked at all relevant
<a href="FAQ-whereFAQ.html">FAQ answers</a> you can find, you&rsquo;ve looked in
any <a href="FAQ-book-lists.html">books</a> you have, and scanned relevant
<a href="FAQ-tutorials*.html">tutorials</a>&hellip; and still you don&rsquo;t know what
to do.

<p>
There are two more steps you can take before formulating a question to
the TeX world at large.

<p>
First, (if you are seeking a particular package or program), start by
looking on your own system: you might already have what you seek&nbsp;&mdash;
the better TeX distributions provide a wide range of supporting
material.  The <a href="FAQ-catalogue.html">CTAN Catalogue</a> can also
identify packages that might help: you can 
<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/search">search it</a>, or you can browse it


&ldquo;<a href="http://mirrors.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html">by topic</a>&rdquo;.





Each catalogue entry has a brief description of the package, and links to
known documentation on the net.  In fact, a large proportion of
CTAN package directories now include documentation, so it&rsquo;s
often worth looking at the catalogue entry for a package you&rsquo;re considering
using (where possible, each package link in the main body of these
FAQs has a link to
the relevant catalogue entry).

<p>
Failing that, look to see if anyone has solved the problem before;
places where people ask are:
<ol>
<li> newsgroup <i class="newsgroup">comp.text.tex</i>, whose &ldquo;historical posts&rdquo;
  are accessible via
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex">Google groups</a>,
  and
<li> the mailing list <tt>texhax</tt> via its
  <a href="http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/">archive</a>, or via the &lsquo;Gmane&rsquo;
  newsgroup <i class="newsgroup">gmane.comp.tex.texhax</i>, which holds a
  <em>very</em> long history of the list.  A long shot would be to
  search the archives of the mailing list&rsquo;s ancient posts on
  CTAN, which go back to the days when it was a digest: in
  those days, a question asked in one issue would only ever be
  answered in the next one.
</ol>
If the &ldquo;back question&rdquo; searches fail, you must ask the world at
large.

<p>
So, how do you like to ask questions?&nbsp;&mdash; the three available
mechanisms are:
<ol>
<li> Mailing lists: there are various specialist mailing lists, but
  the place for &lsquo;general&rsquo; (La)TeX queries is the <tt>texhax</tt>
  mailing list.  Mail to <a href="mailto:texhax@tug.org">texhax@tug.org</a> to ask a question,
  but it&rsquo;s probably better to subscribe to the list
  (via <a href="http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax">http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax</a>) 
  first&nbsp;&mdash; not everyone will answer to you as well as to the list.
<li> Newsgroup: to ask a question on <i class="newsgroup">comp.text.tex</i>, you
  can use your own news client (if you have one), or use the &ldquo;+ new
  post&rdquo; button on
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex</a>.
<li> Web forum: alternatives are: the 
  <a href="http://www.latex-community.org/">&ldquo;LaTeX community&rdquo; site</a>,
  which offers a variety of &lsquo;categories&rsquo; to place your query, and the
  
  <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/">TeX, LaTeX and friends Q&amp;A site</a>
  (&ldquo;StackExchange&rdquo;).

<p>
  StackExchange has a scheme for voting on the quality of answers (and
  hence of those who offer support).  This arrangement is supposed to
  enable you to rank any answers that are posted.

<p>
  StackExchange offers
  <a href="http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1436/welcome-to-tex-sx">hints about &ldquo;good behaviour&rdquo;</a>,
  which any user should at least scan before asking for help there.
  (The hints&rsquo; principal aim is to maximise the chance that you get useful
  advice from the first answer; for example, it suggests that you supply a
  <a href="FAQ-askquestion.html">minimal example of your problem</a>, just as
  these FAQs do.  There are people on the site who can be abrasive
  to those asking questions, who seem not to be following the
  guidelines for good behaviour)
</ol>
Do <b>not</b> try mailing the LaTeX project team, the maintainers
of the texlive or MiKTeX distributions or the maintainers of
these FAQs for help; while all these addresses reach
experienced (La)TeX users, no small group can possibly have
expertise in every area of usage so that the &ldquo;big&rdquo; lists and forums
are a far better bet.
