<h1>Tidying up after installation</h1>


<p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s not usually a lot to do after you&rsquo;ve completed the steps
above&nbsp;&mdash; indeed, if you&rsquo;re merely installed files direct from the
archive, or whatever, there will be precisely nothing left, by way of
debris.

<p>
Things you might care to clean up are:
<ul>
<li> the archive file, if you retrieved your data from the archive
  as a <code class="extension">zip</code> file, or the like;
<li> the <code class="extension">dtx</code> and <code class="extension">ins</code> files, if you chose not
  to install them with the documentation; and
<li> the <code class="extension">aux</code>, <code class="extension">log</code>, <code class="extension">idx</code>, etc.,
  from building the documentation.
</ul>
A simple way of achieving all this is to download to a working
directory that was created for the purpose, and then to delete that
directory and all its contents after you&rsquo;ve finished installing.
