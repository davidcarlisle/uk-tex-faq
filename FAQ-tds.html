<h1>What is the TDS?</h1>


<p>

<p>
TDS is an acronym for &ldquo;TeX Directory Structure&rdquo;; it
specifies a standard way of organising all the TeX-related files on
a computer system.

<p>
Most modern distributions arrange their TeX files in conformance
with the TDS, using both a &lsquo;distribution&rsquo; directory tree and a
(set of) &lsquo;local&rsquo; directory trees, each containing TeX-related
files.  The TDS recommends the name <tt>texmf</tt> for the name
of the root directory (folder) of an hierarchy; in practice there are
typically several such trees, each of which has a name that compounds
that (e.g., <tt>texmf-dist</tt>, <tt>texmf-var</tt>).

<p>
Files supplied as part of the distribution are put into the
distribution&rsquo;s tree, but the location of the distribution&rsquo;s hierarchy is
system dependent.  (On a Unix system it might be at
<tt class="path">/usr/share/texmf</tt> or <tt class="path">/opt/texmf</tt>, or a similar location.)

<p>
There may be more than one &lsquo;local&rsquo; hierarchy in which additional files
can be stored.  An installation will also typically offer a local
hierarchy, while each user may have an individual local hierarchy.

<p>
The TDS itself is published as the output of a TUG 
<a href="FAQ-TUG*.html">Technical Working Group</a>.  You may browse an
<a href="http://tug.org/tds/.html">on-line version</a> of the standard, and
copies in several other formats (including source) are available on
CTAN.
