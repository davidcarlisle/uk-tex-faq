<h1>Footnotes in captions</h1>


<p>

<p>
Footnotes in captions are especially tricky: they present problems of
their own, on top of the problems one experiences with
<a href="FAQ-ftnsect.html">footnotes in section titles</a> (footnotes migrating to
to the list of figures or tables, or 
<a href="FAQ-extrabrace.html">apparently random errors</a> because
<code>&#x5c;footnote</code> is a fragile command), and with 
<a href="FAQ-footintab.html">footnotes in tables</a> (typically, the footnote
simply disappears).  Fortunately, the requirement for footnotes in
captions is extremely rare: if you are experiencing problems, it is
worth reviewing what you are trying to say by placing this footnote:
other options are to place text at the bottom of the float, or to
place a footnote at the point where you refer to the float.

<p>
Note that the <i class="package">threeparttable</i> scheme (see, again, 
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-footintab.html">footnotes in tables</a>) also applies
to notes in captions, and may very well be preferable to whatever you
were thinking of.

<p>
If you <em>are</em> going to proceed:
<ul>
<li> use an optional argument in your <code>&#x5c;caption</code> command, that
  doesn&rsquo;t have the footnote in it; this prevents the footnote
  appearing in the &ldquo;List of &hellip;&rdquo;, and
<li> put your whole float in a <code class="environment">minipage</code> so as to keep
  the footnotes with the float.
</ul>
so we have:
<blockquote>

<pre>
\begin{figure}
  \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
    ...
    \caption[Compact Routing Example]%
    {Compact Routing\footnote{something} Example}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
</pre>


<pre>
\begin{figure}
  \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
    ...
    \caption[Compact Routing Example]%
        {Compact Routing\footnote{something}
                             Example}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
</pre>

</blockquote>
So, we make an entry for the List of Figures, which doesn&rsquo;t hold
troublesome commands, such as <code>&#x5c;footnote</code>.

<p>
However, <em>as well as</em> all of the above, one <em>also</em> has to
deal with the tendency of the <code>&#x5c;caption</code> command to produce the
footnote&rsquo;s text twice.  For this last problem, there is no tidy
solution this author is aware of.

<p>
If you&rsquo;re suffering the problem, a well-constructed <code>&#x5c;caption</code>
command in a <code class="environment">minipage</code> environment within a float (as
in the example above) can produce <em>two</em> copies of the footnote
body &ldquo;something&rdquo;. (In fact, the effect only occurs with captions that are
long enough to require two lines to be typeset, and so wouldn&rsquo;t appear
with such a short caption as that in the example above.)

<p>
The documentation of the <i class="package">ccaption</i> package describes a really
rather awful work-around for this problem.
