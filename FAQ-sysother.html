<p>

<p>
For PCs, running MSDOS or OS/2, EmTeX (by Eberhard
Mattes) offers LaTeX, BibTeX, previewers, and drivers.  It is
available as a series of zip archives, with documentation in both
German and English.  Appropriate memory managers for using emTeX
with 386 (and better) processors and under pre-&rsquo;9x Windows, are
included in the distribution.  (EmTeX <em>can</em> be made to operate
under Windows, but even back when it was &ldquo;current&rdquo;, such use wasn&rsquo;t
very actively encouraged.)

<p>
A version of emTeX, packaged to use a 
<a href="FAQ-tds.html">TDS directory structure</a>, is separately available as an
emTeX &lsquo;contribution&rsquo;.  Note that neither emTeX itself, nor
emTeX-TDS, is maintained.  Users of Microsoft operating
systems, who want an up-to-date (La)TeX system, need Win32-based
systems.

<p>
For PCs, running MSDOS, a further option is a port of the
Web2C&nbsp;7.0 implementation, using the GNU <i class="progname">djgpp</i>
compiler.  While this package is more recent than emTeX, it
nevertheless also offers a rather old instance of (La)TeX.

<p>
For VAX systems running OpenVMS, a TeX distribution
is available CTAN, but is almost certainly not the latest (it
is more than 10 years old).  Whether a version is even available for
current VMS (which typically runs on Intel 64-bit processors)
is not clear, but it seems unlikely.

<p>
For the Atari ST and TT, CS-TeX is available
from CTAN; it&rsquo;s offered as a set of ZOO archives.

<p>
Amiga users have the option of a full implementations of TeX 3.1
(PasTeX) and MetaFont 2.7.

<p>
It&rsquo;s less likely that hobbyists would be running TOPS-20
machines, but since TeX was originally written on a DEC-10
under WAITS, the TOPS-20 port is another near approach
to Knuth&rsquo;s original environment. Sources are available by anonymous
