<h1>How does hyphenation work in TeX?</h1>


<p>

<p>
Everyone knows what hyphenation is: we see it in most books we read,
and (if we&rsquo;re alert) will spot occasional ridiculous mis-hyphenation
(at one time, British newspapers were a fertile source).

<p>
Hyphenation styles are culturally-determined, and the same language
may be hyphenated differently in different countries&nbsp;&mdash; for example,
British and American styles of hyphenation of English are very
different.  As a result, a typesetting system that is not restricted
to a single language at a single locale needs to be able to change its
hyphenation rules from time to time.

<p>
TeX uses a pretty good system for hyphenation (originally designed
by Frank Liang&nbsp;&mdash; you may view his 
<a href="http://tug.org/docs/liang/">Ph.D. thesis</a> online) and while
it&rsquo;s capable of missing &ldquo;sensible&rdquo; hyphenation points, it seldom
selects grossly wrong ones.  The
algorithm matches candidates for hyphenation against a set of
&ldquo;hyphenation patterns&rdquo;.  The candidates for hyphenation must be
sequences of letters (or other single characters that TeX may be
persuaded to think of as letters).  Non-letters interrupt hyphenation;
this applies to TeX&rsquo;s <code>&#x5c;accent</code> primitive (as in &lsquo;syst&egrave;me&rsquo;)
just as much as the exclamation in&lsquo;syst!eme&rsquo;.

<p>
(Hyphenation takes place on the characters &ldquo;sent to the printer&rdquo;.
The problem with <code>&#x5c;accent</code> is avoided&nbsp;&mdash;in LaTeX&nbsp;&mdash; by the use
of the <i class="package">fontenc</i> package, as discussed in 
&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-hyphenaccents.html">Accented words aren t hyphenated</a>&rdquo;.)

<p>
Sets of hyphenation patterns are usually derived from analysis of
a list of valid hyphenations (the process of derivation, using a tool
called <i class="package">patgen</i>, is not ordinarily a sport to be played by
ordinary mortals).

<p>
The patterns for the languages a TeX system is going to deal with
may only be loaded when the system is installed.  To change the set of
hyphenation patterns recognised by a TeX-based or XeTeX system,
a <a href="FAQ-newlang.html">partial reinstallation</a> is necessary (note that 
<a href="FAQ-luatex.html">LuaTeX</a> relaxes this constraint).

<p>
TeX provides two &ldquo;user-level&rdquo; commands for control of
hyphenation: <code>&#x5c;language</code> (which selects a hyphenation style), and
<code>&#x5c;hyphenation</code> (which gives explicit instructions to the hyphenation
engine, overriding the effect of the patterns).

<p>
The ordinary LaTeX user need not worry about <code>&#x5c;language</code>, since
it is very thoroughly managed by the <i class="package">babel</i> package; use of
<code>&#x5c;hyphenation</code> is discussed in
  the context of
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-nohyph.html">hyphenation failure</a>.
