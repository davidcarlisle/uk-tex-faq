<h1>Translating LaTeX to Plain TeX</h1>


<p>

<p>
Unfortunately, no &ldquo;general&rdquo;, simple, automatic process is likely to
succeed at this task.  See 
&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-LaTeXandPlain.html">How does LaTeX relate to Plain TeX</a>&rdquo;
for further details.

<p>
Obviously, trivial documents will translate in a trivial way.
Documents that use even relatively simple things, such as labels and
references, are likely to cause trouble (Plain TeX doesn&rsquo;t support
labels).  While graphics are in principle covered, by the Plain TeX

<p>
Translating a document designed to work with LaTeX into one
that will work with Plain TeX is likely to amount to carefully
including (or otherwise re-implementing) all those parts of LaTeX,
beyond the provisions of Plain TeX, which the document uses.

<p>
Some of this work has (in a sense) been done, in the port of the
LaTeX graphics package to Plain TeX.  However, while
<i class="package">graphics</i> is available, other complicated packages (notably
<i class="package">hyperref</i>) are not.  The aspiring translator may find the
<a href="FAQ-eplain.html">Eplain</a> system a useful source of code.  (In fact,
a light-weight system such as Eplain might reasonably be adopted as
an alternative target of translation, though it undoubtedly gives the
user more than the &ldquo;bare minimum&rdquo; that Plain TeX is designed to
offer.)
