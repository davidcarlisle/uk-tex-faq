<h1>Only one <code>&#x5c;baselineskip</code> per paragraph</h1>


<p>

<p>
The <code>&#x5c;baselineskip</code>, which determines the space between lines, is
not (as one might hope) a property of a line, but of a paragraph.  As
a result, in a <tt>10pt</tt> (nominal) document (with a default
<code>&#x5c;baselineskip</code> of <tt>12pt</tt>), a single character with a larger
size, as:
<blockquote>
<pre>
{\Huge A}
</pre>
</blockquote>
will be squashed into the paragraph: TeX will make sure it doesn&rsquo;t
scrape up against the line above, but won&rsquo;t give it &ldquo;room to
breathe&rdquo;, as it does the text at standard size; that is, its size
(<tt>24.88pt</tt>) is taken account of, but its <code>&#x5c;baselineskip</code>
(<tt>30pt</tt>) isn&rsquo;t.  This problem may be solved by a <em>strut</em>:
the name comes from movable metal typography, and refers to a spacer
that held the boxes (that contained the metal character shapes) apart.
Every time you change font size, LaTeX redefines the command
<code>&#x5c;strut</code> to provide the equivalent of a metal-type strut for the
size chosen.  So for the example above, we would type
<blockquote>
<pre>
Paragraph text ...
   {\Huge A\strut}
   ... paragraph continues ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
This technique <em>only</em> works for such very short intrusions; if
you need several lines, you should convert your intrusion into a
<code class="environment">quote</code> environment, since it&rsquo;s not possible to provide a
<code>&#x5c;strut</code> command for every line of the intrusion, in a sensible
way, so proceed by:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{quote}
  \Huge A LENGTHY TEXT ...
  SHOUTING AT THE READER!
\end{quote}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The contrary case:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Paragraph text ...
{\footnotesize Extended interjection ...
   ... into the paragraph.}
      ... paragraph continues ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
will look wrong, since the <tt>8pt</tt> interjection will
end up set on the <tt>12pt</tt> <code>&#x5c;baselineskip</code> of the paragraph,
rather than its preferred <tt>8.5pt</tt>.  A <code>&#x5c;strut</code> here is no
help: there is no such thing as a &ldquo;negative strut&rdquo;, that draws lines
together, so once more, one falls back on the <code class="environment">quote</code> to
separate the interjection:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Paragraph text ...
\begin{quote}
  \footnotesize Extended interjection ...
  ... into the paragraph.
\end{quote}
... paragraph continues ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The same effect is at work when we have something like:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Paragraph text ...
  ... paragraph body ends.
{\footnotesize Comment on the paragraph.}

Next paragraph starts...
</pre>
</blockquote>
which will set the body of the first paragraph on the constricted
<code>&#x5c;baselineskip</code> of the <code>&#x5c;footnotesize</code> comment.  Solve this
problem by ending the initial paragraph before starting the comment:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Paragraph text ...
  ... paragraph body ends.
\par\nothtml{\noindent}
{\footnotesize Comment on the paragraph.}

Next paragraph starts...
</pre>
</blockquote>
(We suggest <code>&#x5c;noindent</code> to make the comment look as if it is part
of the paragraph it discusses; omit <code>&#x5c;noindent</code> if that is inappropriate.)

<p>
A variation of the previous issue arises from a paragraph whose size
is different from those around it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
{\Large (Extended) IMPORTANT DETAILS ...}

Main body of text...
</pre>
</blockquote>
Again, the problem is solved by ending the paragraph in the same group
as the text with a different size:
<blockquote>
<pre>
{\Large (Extended) IMPORTANT DETAILS ...\par}

Main body of text...
</pre>
</blockquote>
