<h1>Adjusting the presentation of section numbers</h1>


<p>

<p>
The general issues of adjusting the appearance of section headings are
pretty complex, and are covered in 
the question on
<a class="FA[[[htmlonly]]].html" href="FAQ-secthead.html">the style of section headings</a>.

<p>
However, people regularly want merely to change the way the section
number appears in the heading, and some such people don&rsquo;t mind writing
out a few macros.  This answer is for <em>them</em>.

<p>
The section number is typeset using the




  <a href="FAQ-atsigns.html">LaTeX internal</a>

<code>&#x5c;@seccntformat</code> command, which is given the &ldquo;name&rdquo; (section,
subsection, &hellip;) of the heading, as argument.  Ordinarily,
<code>&#x5c;@seccntformat</code> 
merely outputs the section number, and then a <code>&#x5c;quad</code> of space:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\renewcommand*{\@seccntformat}[1]{%
  \csname the#1\endcsname\quad
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Suppose you want to put a stop after every section (subsection,
subsubsection, &hellip;) number, a trivial change may be implemented by
simple modification of the command:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\renewcommand*{\@seccntformat}[1]{%
  \csname the#1\endcsname.\quad
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
However, many people want to modify section numbers, but not
subsection numbers, or any of the others.  To do this, one must make
<code>&#x5c;@seccntformat</code> switch according to its argument.  The following
technique for doing the job is slightly wasteful, but is efficient
enough for a relatively rare operation:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\renewcommand*{\@seccntformat}[1]{%
  \csname the#1\endcsname
  \csname adddot@#1\endcsname\quad
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which uses a second-level command to provide the dot, if it has been
defined; otherwise it merely appends <code>&#x5c;relax</code> (which does nothing
in this context).  The definition of the second-level command (the
version for the <tt>section</tt>, here) specifies what to put after a
section number, but it could be used to put anything after it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\newcommand*{\adddot@section}{.}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that all the command definitions above are dealing in
<a href="FAQ-atsigns.html">LaTeX internal commands</a>, so the above
code should be in a package file, for preference.

<p>
The <i class="class">Koma-script</i> classes have different commands for specifying
changes to section number presentation: <code>&#x5c;partformat</code>,
<code>&#x5c;chapterformat</code> and <code>&#x5c;othersectionlevelsformat</code>, but otherwise
their facilities are similar to those of &ldquo;raw&rdquo; LaTeX.
