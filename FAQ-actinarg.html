<h1>Active characters in command arguments</h1>


<p>

<p>
Occasionally, it&rsquo;s nice to make one or two characters active in the
argument of a command, to make it easier for authors to code the
arguments.

<p>
Active characters <em>can</em> be used safely in such situations; but
care is needed.

<p>
An example arose while this answer was being considered: an aspirant
macro writer posted to <i class="newsgroup">comp.text.tex</i> asking for help to
make <code class="verb">#</code> and <code class="verb">b</code> produce musical sharp and flat signs, respectively,
in a macro for specifying chords.

<p>
The first problem is that both <code class="verb">#</code> and <code class="verb">b</code> have rather important uses
elsewhere in TeX (to say the least!), so that the characters can
only be made active while the command is executing.

<p>
Using the techniques discussed in 
&ldquo;<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-activechars.html">characters as commands</a>&rdquo;,
we can define:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begingroup
  \catcode`\#=\active
  \gdef#{$\sharp$}
\endgroup
</pre>
</blockquote>
and:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begingroup
  \lccode`\~=`\b
  \lowercase{\endgroup
    \def~{$\flat$}%
  }
</pre>
</blockquote>
The second problem is one of timing: the command has to make each
character active <em>before</em> its arguments are read: this means that
the command can&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;have&rdquo; arguments itself, but must be
split in two.  So we write:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\def\chord{%
  \begingroup
    \catcode`\#=\active
    \catcode`\b=\active
    \Xchord
}
\def\Xchord#1{%
    \chordfont#1%
  \endgroup
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
and we can use the command as <code>&#x5c;chord</code><code>&#x7b;F\#&#x7d;</code> or
<code>&#x5c;chord</code><code>&#x7b;Bb minor&#x7d;</code>.

<p>
Two features of the coding are important:
<ul>
<li> <code>&#x5c;begingroup</code> in <code>&#x5c;chord</code> opens a group that is closed by
  <code>&#x5c;endgroup</code> in <code>&#x5c;Xchord</code>; this group limits the change of
  category codes, which is the <em>raison d&rsquo;\^etre</em> of the whole
  exercise.
<li> Although <code class="verb">#</code> is active while <code>&#x5c;Xchord</code> is executed, it&rsquo;s
  <em>not</em> active when it&rsquo;s being defined, so that the use of <code class="verb">#1</code>
  doesn&rsquo;t require any special attention.
</ul>

<p>
Note that the technique used in such macros as <code>&#x5c;chord</code>, here, is
analogous to that used in such commands as <code>&#x5c;verb</code>; and, in just the
same way as <code>&#x5c;verb</code> (see

&ldquo;<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-verbwithin.html"><code>&#x5c;verb</code> doesn&rsquo;t work in arguments</a>&rdquo;),
<code>&#x5c;chord</code> won&rsquo;t work inside the argument of another command (the
error messages, if they appear at all, will probably be rather odd).
