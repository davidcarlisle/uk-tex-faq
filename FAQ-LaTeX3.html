<p>

<p>
The LaTeX project team (see <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html.html">http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html</a>)
is a small group of volunteers whose aim is
to produce a major new document processing system based on the
principles pioneered by Leslie Lamport in the current LaTeX.  The
new system is (provisionally) called LaTeX3; it
will remain freely available and it will be fully documented at
all levels.

<p>
The LaTeX team&rsquo;s first product (LaTeX 2e) was delivered in 1994
(it&rsquo;s now properly called &ldquo;LaTeX&rdquo;, since no other version is current).

<p>
LaTeX 2e was intended as a consolidation exercise, unifying several
sub-variants of LaTeX while changing nothing whose change wasn&rsquo;t
absolutely necessary.  This has permitted the team to support a single
version of LaTeX, in parallel with development of LaTeX3.

<p>
Some of the older discussion papers about directions for LaTeX3 are
to be found on CTAN; other (published) articles are to be found
on the project web site (<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/papers/.html">http://www.latex-project.org/papers/</a>).

<p>
Some of the project&rsquo;s experimental code is visible on the net:
<ul>
<li> via <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/code.html.html">http://www.latex-project.org/code.html</a>, which points
  to the project&rsquo;s SVN repository;
<li> via the project&rsquo;s
  <a href="https://github.com/latex3/svn-mirror.html"><em>GitHub</em> mirror</a>;
<li> from CTAN: snapshots of two major collections from the
  code, <i class="package">l3kernel</i> (supporting LaTeX3 coding conventions in
  a LaTeX 2e environment), <i class="package">l3packages</i> (a first cut of a
  &ldquo;document designer&rsquo;s interface&rdquo;) as well as
  <i class="package">l3experimental</i> (new stuff that&rsquo;s still under
  development).
</ul>
The packages <i class="package">l3kernel</i> and <i class="package">l3packages</i> provide an
&ldquo;experimental harness&rdquo; that may be used as a testbed for LaTeX3
work.

<p>
Note that <i class="package">l3kernel</i> introduces a coding structure quite
different from earlier LaTeX code; a few hardy authors, who are not
members of the project, are nevertheless using it in their development
work.

<p>
Anyone may participate in discussions of the future of LaTeX
through the mailing list <tt>latex-l</tt>; some development work
(outside the project) is discussed on the list.  Subscribe to the list
