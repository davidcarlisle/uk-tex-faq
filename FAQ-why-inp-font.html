<h1>Why bother with <i class="package">inputenc</i> and <i class="package">fontenc</i>?</h1>


<p>

<p>
The standard input encoding for Western Europe (pending the arrival of
Unicode) is ISO&nbsp;8859&ndash;1 (commonly known by the standard&rsquo;s
subtitle &lsquo;Latin-1&rsquo;).  Latin-1 is remarkably close, in the codepoints
it covers, to the (La)TeX T1 encoding.

<p>
In this circumstance, why should one bother with <i class="package">inputenc</i>
and <i class="package">fontenc</i>?  Since they&rsquo;re pretty exactly mirroring each
other, one could do away with both, and use just <i class="package">t1enc</i>,
despite its <a href="FAQ-t1enc.html">shortcomings</a>.

<p>
One doesn&rsquo;t do this for a variety of small reasons:
<dl>
<dt class="description">Confusion</dt><dd> You&rsquo;ve been happily working in this mode, and for
  some reason find you&rsquo;re to switch to writing in German: the effect
  of using &ldquo;<tt>&szlig;</tt>&rdquo; is somewhat startling, since T1
  and Latin-1 treat the codepoint differently.
<dt class="description">Compatibility</dt><dd> You find yourself needing to work with a
  colleague in Eastern Europe: their keyboard is likely to be set to
  produce Latin-2, so that the simple mapping doesn&rsquo;t work.
<dt class="description">Traditional LaTeX</dt><dd> You lapse and write something like
  <code>&#x5c;&rsquo;</code><code>&#x7b;e&#x7d;</code> rather than typing <tt>&eacute;</tt>; only <i class="package">fontenc</i>
  has the means to convert this LaTeX sequence into the T1
  character, so an <code>&#x5c;accent</code> primitive slips through into the
  output, and hyphenation is in danger.
</dl>
The <i class="package">inputenc</i>&ndash;<i class="package">fontenc</i> combination seems slow and
cumbersome, but it&rsquo;s safe.
