<h1>How to typeset an underscore character</h1>


<p>

<p>
The underscore character &lsquo;<tt>\_</tt>&rsquo; is ordinarily used in TeX to
indicate a subscript in maths mode; if you type <tt>\_</tt>, on its
own, in the course of ordinary text, TeX will complain.  The
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; LaTeX command for underscore is <code>&#x5c;textunderscore</code>,
but the LaTeX 2.09 command <code>&#x5c;\_</code> is an established alias.  Even so,
if you&rsquo;re writing a document which will contain a large number of
underscore characters, the prospect of typing <code>&#x5c;\_</code> for every one
of them will daunt most ordinary people.

<p>
Moderately skilled macro programmers can readily generate a quick hack
to permit typing &lsquo;<tt>\_</tt>&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;text underscore&rsquo; (the answer in

  &ldquo;<a href="FAQ-activechars.html">defining characters as macros</a>&rdquo;




uses this example to illustrate its techniques).
However, the code <em>is</em> somewhat tricky, and more importantly
there are significant points where it&rsquo;s easy to get it wrong.  There
is therefore a package <i class="package">underscore</i> which provides a general
solution to this requirement.

<p>
There is a problem, though: OT1 text fonts don&rsquo;t contain an
underscore character, unless they&rsquo;re in the typewriter version of the
encoding (used by fixed-width fonts such as <tt>cmtt</tt>).  In place
of such a character, LaTeX (in OT1 encoding) uses a short rule
for the command <code>&#x5c;textunderscore</code>, but this poses problems
for systems that interpret PDF&nbsp;&mdash; for example those
PDF-to-voice systems used by those who find reading difficult.

<p>
So either you must ensure that your underscore characters only occur
in text set in a typewriter font, or you must use a more modern
encoding, such as T1, which has the same layout for every font,
and thus an underscore in every font.

<p>
A stable procedure to achieve this is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% (1) choose a font that is available as T1
% for example:
\usepackage{lmodern}

% (2) specify encoding
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% (3) load symbol definitions
\usepackage{textcomp}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which will provide a command <code>&#x5c;textunderscore</code> which robustly
selects the right character.  The <i class="package">underscore</i> package,
mentioned above, will use this command.
