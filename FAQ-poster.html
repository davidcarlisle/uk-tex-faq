<p>

<p>
There is no complete &ldquo;canned solution&rdquo; to creating a poster (as, for
example, classes like <i class="class">seminar</i>, <i class="class">powerdot</i> and
<i class="class">beamer</i> serve for creating presentations in a variety of
styles).

<p>
The nearest approach to the complete solution is the <i class="class">sciposter</i>
class, which provides the means to produce really rather good posters
according to the author&rsquo;s required style.  A complete worked example
is provided with the distribution

<p>
Otherwise, there is a range of tools, most of which are based on the
<i class="class">a0poster</i> class, which sets up an appropriately-sized piece of
paper, sets font sizes appropriately, and leaves you to your own
devices.

<p>
Having used <i class="class">a0poster</i>, you can of course slog it out, and write
all your poster as an unadorned LaTeX document (presumably in
multiple columns, using the <i class="package">multicol</i> package), but it&rsquo;s not really
necessary: the (straightforward) <i class="package">textpos</i> package provides a
simple way of positioning chunks of text, or tables or figures, on the
poster page.

<p>
More sophisticated is the <i class="package">flowfram</i> package, whose basic aim
in life is flowing text from one box on the page to the next.  One of
the package&rsquo;s design aims seems to have been the production of
posters, and a worked example is provided.  The author of
<i class="package">flowfram</i> has an experimental tool called
<a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/software.html#jpgfdraw.html">JpgfDraw</a>, which
allows you to construct the outline of frames for use with
<i class="package">flowfram</i>.

<p>
The <i class="package">beamerposter</i> package is added to a 
<a href="FAQ-slidecls.html"><i class="class">beamer</i> document</a> to enable the user to work
as if in a <i class="class">a0poster</i> class.  Thus <i class="class">beamer</i>&rsquo;s neat
provisions for layout may be used when creating the poster.
Documentation of <i class="package">beamerposter</i> is sparse, but an example file
allows the user to get a grip on what&rsquo;s available.

<p>
Despite the relative shortage of tools, there are a fair few web pages
that explain the process (mostly in terms of the <i class="class">a0poster</i>
route):
<ul>
<li> from Norman Gray, 
  <a href="http://nxg.me.uk/docs/posters/.html">Producing posters using LaTeX</a>;
<li> from Nicola Talbot,

<li> From Rob Clark 
  <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/robert/posters/advanced.html.html">Advanced LaTeX Posters</a>

<li> from Brian Wolven, 
  <a href="http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/&nbsp;wolven/posters.html.html">LaTeX Poster Macros, Examples, and Accessories</a> 
  (this page also provides macros and other support suggestions); and
<li> from &ldquo;<em>pjh</em>&rdquo; 
  <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/&nbsp;pjh/posters/poster_howto_UF.html.html">Making and printing a poster with LaTeX</a>, 
  which covers the specific issue of dealing with University of
  Florida styled poster (offering supporting material as necessary),
  but has hints which are generally useful.
