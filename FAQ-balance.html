<h1>Balancing columns at the end of a document</h1>


<p>

<p>
The <i class="package">twocolumn</i> option of the standard classes causes
LaTeX to set the text of a document in two columns.  However, the last
page of the document typically ends up with columns of different
lengths&nbsp;&mdash; such columns are said to be &ldquo;unbalanced&rdquo;.  Many (most?)
people don&rsquo;t like unbalanced columns.

<p>
The simplest solution to the problem is to use the <i class="package">multicol</i>
package in place of the <i class="package">twocolumn</i> option, as
<i class="package">multicol</i> balances the columns on the final page by default.
However, the use of <i class="package">multicol</i> does come at a cost: its
special output routine disallows the use of in-column floats, though
it does still permit full-width (e.g., <code class="environment">figure*</code>
environment) floats. 

<p>
As a result, there is a constant push for a means of balancing columns
at the end of a <i class="package">twocolumn</i> document.  Of course, the job can
be done manually: <code>&#x5c;pagebreak</code> inserted at the appropriate place on
the last page can often produce the right effect, but this seldom
appeals, and if the last page is made up of automatically-generated
text (for example, bibliography or index) inserting the command will
be difficult.

<p>
The <i class="package">flushend</i> package offers a solution to this problem.  It&rsquo;s a
somewhat dangerous piece of macro code, which patches one of the most
intricate parts of the LaTeX kernel without deploying any of the
safeguards discussed in <a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-patch.html">patching commands</a>.
The package only changes the behaviour at end document (its
<code>&#x5c;flushend</code> command is enabled by default), and one other command
permits adjustment of the final balance; other packages in the bundle
provide means for insertion of full width material in two-column
documents.

<p>
The <i class="package">balance</i> package also patches the output routine
(somewhat more carefully than <i class="package">flushend</i>).

<p>
The user should be aware that any of these packages are liable to
become confused in the presence of floats: if problems arise, manual
adjustment of the floats in the document is likely to be necessary.
It is this difficulty (what&rsquo;s required in any instance can&rsquo;t really be
expressed in current LaTeX) that led the author of
<i class="package">multicol</i> to suppress single-column-wide floats.
