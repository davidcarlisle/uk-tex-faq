<h1>Repositories of TeX material</h1>


<p>

<p>
To aid the archiving and retrieval of of TeX-related files, a
TUG working group developed the Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network (CTAN).  Each CTAN site has identical material,
and maintains authoritative versions of its material.  These
collections are extensive; in particular, almost everything mentioned
in this FAQ
is archived at the CTAN sites (see the lists of software at the
end of each answer).

<p>
There are two main CTAN sites (in Germany and the UK),
but users should ordinarily collect material via the 
<a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/">CTAN mirror redirector</a>
(which connects you to a mirror that is in some sense &ldquo;near&rdquo; to
you).

<p>
To access a particular thing through the <tt>mirror.ctan.org</tt>
mechanism, simply place the CTAN path after the base
URL; so
<a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/footmisc/">http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/footmisc/</a> will
connect you to the <i class="package">footmisc</i> directory at some CTAN
mirror.

<p>
For details of how to find files at CTAN sites, see
&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-findfiles.html">finding (La)TeX files</a>&rdquo;.

<p>
The TeX user who has no access to any sort of
network may buy a copy of the archive as part of the
<a href="FAQ-CD.html">texlive distribution</a>; the disc is, necessarily, out
of date, but it is likely to be better than what (if anything) came
with your operating system.
