<p>

<p>
The acronym stands for &ldquo;Comprehensive TeX Archive Network&rdquo;, which
more-or-less specifies what it&rsquo;s <em>for</em>:
<ul>
<li> The archives offer a comprehensive collection of TeX resources.
<li> The content is made publicly accessible, via the internet.
<li> CTAN is a <em>network</em> of archives, which strive to
  stay in step with one another.
</ul>
The basic framework was developed by a TUG working group set up
to resolve the (then existing) requirement for users to <em>know</em> on
which archive site a particular package might be found.

<p>
Actual implementation offers three distinct types of host:
<dl>
<dt class="description"><em>Core</em> archives</dt><dd>Which form a small, tightly-coupled set of
  machines, which perform management functions as well as serving
  files;
<dt class="description"><em>Mirror</em> archives</dt><dd>Which do no more than take regular copies
  of core archives, and serve them; and
<dt class="description">Archive selector</dt><dd>Which is a meta-service, which routes requests
  to an apparently &ldquo;local&rdquo; mirror (&ldquo;local&rdquo; is determined by an
  algorithm that uses your net address to determine where you are, and
  then selects a mirror that&rsquo;s close).
</dl>
Note that there is nothing to prevent any archive from supporting
other functions, so a CTAN mirror may also operate as a
CPAN (Perl) mirror and as a SourceForge (general free software)
mirror, and &hellip;

<p>
Functions that distinguish core archives are:
<ul>
<li> Uploads: users may submit new (or updated) material via the
  <a href="FAQ-uploads.html">upload redirector</a>. Significant changes to the
  archive are reported via the mailing list [[[Email]]][[[LBRACE]]]ctan-ann@dante.de[[[RBRACE]]]
<li> Weak consistency: changes to the content of the archives are
  rapidly distributed to all core archives.  (Consistency is &lsquo;weak&rsquo;
  since changes can take several minutes to propagate.)
<li> Providing distribution (texlive and MiKTeX) support.
<li> Catalogue maintenance.
<li> Mirror monitoring.
</ul>

<p>
Users may make direct contact with the




  <a href="mailto:ctan@dante.de.html">CTAN management team</a>.


<p>
Users should ordinarily download material from CTAN via the
[[[href]]]*[[[LBRACE]]]http://mirror.ctan.org/[[[RBRACE]]][[[LBRACE]]]archive selector[[[RBRACE]]]: this uses the
mirror monitor&rsquo;s database, and uses the caller&rsquo;s geographical location to
offer an efficient choice of &ldquo;sufficiently up-to-date&rdquo; mirror site for
you to connect to.  This procedure has the advantage of distributing
the load on CTAN mirrors.

<p>
Note that all the download links, given in the web representation of
these FAQs, are set up to use the mirror selector.
