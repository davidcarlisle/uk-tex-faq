<!-- compound initials, transcribed initials -->

<p>
If your bibliographic style uses initials&nbsp;+ surname, you may encounter
a problem with some transcribed names (for example, Russian ones).
Consider the following example from the real world:
<blockquote>

<pre>
@article{epifanov1997,
   author = {Epifanov, S. Yu. and
             Vigasin, A. A.},
   title  = ...
}
</pre>


<pre>
@article{epifanov1997,
   author = {Epifanov, S. Yu. and Vigasin, A. A.},
   title  = ...
}
</pre>

</blockquote>
Note that the &ldquo;Yu&rdquo; is the initial, not a complete name. However,
BibTeX&rsquo;s algorithms will leave you with a citation&nbsp;&mdash; 
slightly depending on the bibliographic style&nbsp;&mdash; that reads:
&ldquo;S. Y. Epifanov and A. A. Vigasin, &hellip;&rdquo;. instead of the intended
&ldquo;S. Yu. Epifanov and A. A. Vigasin, &hellip;&rdquo;.

<p>
One solution is to replace each affected initial by a command that 
prints the correct combination.  To keep your bibliography portable,
you need to add that command to your bibliography with the
<tt>@preamble</tt> directive:
<blockquote>

<pre>
@preamble{ {\providecommand{\BIBYu}{Yu} } }

@article{epifanov1997,
   author   = {Epifanov, S. {\BIBYu}. and
               Vigasin, A. A.},
   title    = ...
}
</pre>


<pre>
@preamble{ {\providecommand{\BIBYu}{Yu} } }

@article{epifanov1997,
   author   = {Epifanov, S. {\BIBYu}. and Vigasin, A. A.},
   title    = ...
}
</pre>

</blockquote>
If you have many such commands, you may want to put them in a separate
file and <code>&#x5c;input</code> that LaTeX file in a <tt>@preamble</tt>
directive.

<p>
An alternative is to make the transcription look like an accent, from
BibTeX&rsquo;s point of view.  For this we need a control sequence that
does nothing:

<blockquote>
<pre>
@article{epifanov1997,
   author   = {Epifanov, S. {\relax Yu}. and Vigasin, A. A.},
   title    = ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>



<pre>
@article{epifanov1997,
   author   = {Epifanov, S. {\relax Yu}. and
               Vigasin, A. A.},
   title    = ...
}
</pre>


Like the solution by generating extra commands, this involves tedious
extra typing; which of the two techniques is preferable for a given
bibliography will be determined by the names in it.  It should be
noted that a preamble that introduces lots of odd commands is usually
undesirable if the bibliography is a shared one.

<p>
&ldquo;Compound&rdquo; initials (for single names made up of two or more words)
may be treated in the same way, so one can enter Forster&rsquo;s rather
complicated name as:

<blockquote>
<pre>
@article{forster2006,
  author   = {Forster, P.M. {\relax de F.} and Collins, M.},
  title    = ...
</pre>
</blockquote>



<pre>
@article{forster2006,
  author   = {Forster, P.M. {\relax de F.} and
              Collins, M.},
  title    = ...
</pre>


The same trick can be played if you&rsquo;re entering whole names:
<blockquote>
<pre>
...
  author   = {Epifanov, Sasha {\relax Yu}ri and
...
</pre>
</blockquote>
(though no guarantee, that either of those names is right, is
offered!)
However, if you&rsquo;re typing the names in the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; (Western) way,
with given names first, the trick:
<blockquote>
<pre>
...
  author   = {P.M. {\relax de F.} Forster and
...
</pre>
</blockquote>
doesn&rsquo;t work&nbsp;&mdash; &ldquo;de F. Forster&rdquo; is treated as a compound family
names.
