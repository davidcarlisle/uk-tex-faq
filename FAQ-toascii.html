<p>

<p>
The aim here is to emulate the Unix <i class="progname">nroff</i>, which formats
text as best it can for the screen, from the same
input as the Unix typesetting program <i class="progname">troff</i>.

<p>
Converting DVI to plain text is the basis of many of these
techniques; sometimes the simple conversion provides a good enough
response.  Options are:
<ul>
<li> <i class="progname">dvi2tty</i> (one of the earliest),
<li> <i class="progname">crudetype</i> and
<li> <i class="progname">catdvi</i>, which is capable of generating Latin-1
  (ISO&nbsp;8859-1) or UTF-8 encoded output.  <i class="progname">Catdvi</i> was
  conceived as a replacement for <i class="progname">dvi2tty</i>, but development
  seems to have stopped before the authors were willing to declare the
  work complete.
</ul>
A common problem is the hyphenation that TeX inserts when
typesetting something: since the output is inevitably viewed using
fonts that don&rsquo;t match the original, the hyphenation usually looks
silly.

<p>
Ralph Droms provides a <i class="package">txt</i> bundle of things in support of
ASCII generation,
but it doesn&rsquo;t do a good job with tables and mathematics.

<p>
Another possibility is to
use the LaTeX-to-ASCII conversion program, <i class="progname">l2a</i>,
although this is really more of a de-TeXing program.

<p>
The canonical de-TeXing program is <i class="progname">detex</i>, which removes
all comments and control sequences 
from its input before writing it to its output.  Its original purpose
was to prepare input for a dumb spelling checker, and it&rsquo;s only usable
for preparing useful ASCII versions of a document in highly
restricted circumstances.

<p>
<i class="progname">Tex2mail</i> is slightly more than a de-TeX[[[LBRACE]]][[[RBRACE]]]er&nbsp;&mdash; it&rsquo;s a
<i class="progname">Perl</i> script that converts TeX files into
plain text files, expanding various mathematical symbols
(sums, products, integrals, sub/superscripts, fractions, square
roots, &hellip;\@) into &ldquo;ASCII art&rdquo; that spreads over
multiple lines if necessary. The result is more readable to human
beings than the flat-style TeX code.

<p>
Another significant possibility is to use one of the
<a href="FAQ-LaTeX2HTML.html">HTML-generation solutions</a>,
and then to use a browser such as <i class="progname">lynx</i> to dump the resulting
HTML as plain text.
