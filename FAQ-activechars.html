<p>

<p>
Single characters can act as macros (defined commands), and both
Plain TeX and LaTeX define the character
&ldquo;<tt>&#x7e;</tt>&rdquo; as a &ldquo;non-breakable space&rdquo;.  A
character is made definable, or &ldquo;active&rdquo;, by setting its
<em>category code</em> (catcode) to be <code>&#x5c;active</code> (13):
<blockquote>
<pre>
\catcode`\_=\active
</pre>
</blockquote>
Any character could, in principle, be activated this way and defined
as a macro:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\def_{\_}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which could be characterised as an over-simple answer to 
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-underscore.html">using underscores</a>.  However, you must be
wary: whereas people expect an active tilde, other active characters
may be unexpected and interact badly with other macros.  Furthermore,
by defining an active character, you preclude the character&rsquo;s use for
other purposes, and there are few characters &ldquo;free&rdquo; to be subverted
in this way.

<p>
To define the character &ldquo;<tt>z</tt>&rdquo; as a command, one would say something
like:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\catcode`\z=\active
\def z{Yawn, I'm tired}%
</pre>
</blockquote>
and each subsequent &ldquo;<tt>z</tt>&rdquo; in the text would become a
yawn. This would be an astoundingly bad idea for most documents, but
might have special applications.  (Note that, in &ldquo;<code>&#x5c;def</code>[[[texttt]]][[[LBRACE]]]
  z[[[RBRACE]]]&rdquo;, &ldquo;<tt>z</tt>&rdquo; is no longer interpreted as a letter; the space
is therefore not necessary&nbsp;&mdash; &ldquo;<code>&#x5c;defz</code>&rdquo; would do; we choose to
retain the space, for what little clarity we can manage.)
Some LaTeX packages facilitate such definitions. For example, the
<i class="package">shortvrb</i> package with its <code>&#x5c;MakeShortVerb</code> command.

<p>
TeX uses category codes to interpret characters as they are read 
from the input.

<em>Changing a catcode value will not affect characters that have already been read</em>.
Therefore, it is best if characters have fixed category codes for the
duration of a document.  If catcodes are changed for particular
purposes (the <code>&#x5c;verb</code> command does this), then the altered
characters will not be interpreted properly when they  appear in the
argument to another command (as, for example, in

&ldquo;<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-verbwithin.html"><code>&#x5c;verb</code> in command arguments</a>&rdquo;).
An exemplary case is the <i class="package">doc</i> package, which processes .dtx
files using the <i class="package">shortvrb</i> package to define
<tt>[[[textbar]]]&hellip;[[[textbar]]]</tt> as a shorthand for
<code>&#x5c;verb</code><tt>[[[textbar]]]&hellip;[[[textbar]]]</tt>. But <tt>[[[textbar]]]</tt> is
also used in the preambles of tabular environments, so that tables in
<code class="extension">dtx</code> files can only have vertical line separation between
columns by employing special measures of some sort.

<p>
Another consequence is that catcode assignments made
in macros often don&rsquo;t work as expected 
(see &ldquo;<a href="FAQ-actinarg.html">Active characters in command arguments</a>&rdquo;).
For example, the definition
<blockquote>
<pre>
\def\mistake{%
\catcode`_=\active
\def_{\textunderscore\-}%
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
does not work because it attempts to define an ordinary <tt>\_</tt> character:
When the macro is used, the category change does not apply to the 
underscore character already in the macro definition.  Instead, one may
use:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begingroup
\catcode`_=\active
\gdef\works{%    note the global \gdef
  \catcode`_=\active
  \def_{\textunderscore\-}%
}
\endgroup
</pre>
</blockquote>
The alternative (&ldquo;tricksy&rdquo;) way of creating such an isolated
definition depends on the curious properties of <code>&#x5c;lowercase</code>, which
changes characters without altering their catcodes.  Since there is
always <em>one</em> active character (&ldquo;<tt>&#x7e;</tt>&rdquo;), we
can fool <code>&#x5c;lowercase</code> into patching up a definition without ever
explicitly changing a catcode:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begingroup
  \lccode`\~=`\_
  \lowercase{\endgroup
    \def~{\textunderscore\-}%
  }%
</pre>
</blockquote>
The two definitions have the same overall effect (the character is
defined as a command, but the character does not remain active),
except that the first defines a <code>&#x5c;global</code> command.

<p>
For active characters to be used only in maths mode, it is much better
to leave the character having its ordinary catcode, but assign it a
special active <em>maths code</em>, as with
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begingroup
  \lccode`~=`x
  \lowercase{\endgroup
    \def~{\times}%
  }%
\mathcode`x="8000
</pre>
</blockquote>
The special character does not need to be redefined whenever it is
made active&nbsp;&mdash; the definition of the command persists even if the
character&rsquo;s catcode reverts to its original value; the definition
becomes accessible again if the character once again becomes active.
