<h1>&ldquo;Normal&rdquo; use of BibTeX from LaTeX</h1>


<p>

<p>
To create a bibliography for your document, you need to perform a
sequence of steps, some of which seem a bit odd.  If you choose to use
BibTeX, the sequence is:

<p>
First: you need a BibTeX bibliography file (a <code class="extension">bib</code>
file)&nbsp;&mdash; see <a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-buildbib.html">&ldquo;creating a BibTeX file&rdquo;</a>.

<p>
Second: you must write your LaTeX document to include a declaration
of the &lsquo;style&rsquo; of bibliography, citations, and a reference to the
bibliography file mentioned above.  So we may have a LaTeX
file containing:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\bibliographystyle{plain}
...
Pooh is heroic~\cite{Milne:1926}.
...
Alice struggles~\cite{Carroll:1865}.
...
\bibliography{mybooks}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note: we have bibliography style <i class="package">plain</i>, above, which is
nearly the simplest of the lot: a sample text, showing the sorts of
style choices available, can be found on Ken Turner&rsquo;s web site:
<a href="http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/software/latex/showbst.html">http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/&nbsp;kjt/software/latex/showbst.html</a>

<p>
Third: you must process the file.
<blockquote>
<pre>
latex myfile
</pre>
</blockquote>
As LaTeX processes the file, the <code>&#x5c;bibliographystyle</code> command
writes a note of the style to the <code class="extension">aux</code> file; each
<code>&#x5c;cite</code> command writes a note of the citation to the
<code class="extension">aux</code> file, and the <code>&#x5c;bibliography</code> command writes a note
of which <code class="extension">bib</code> file is to be used, to the <code class="extension">aux</code> file.

<p>
Note that, at this stage, LaTeX isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;resolving&rdquo; any of the
citations: at every <code>&#x5c;cite</code> command, LaTeX will warn you of the
undefined citation, and when the document finishes, there will be a
further warning of undefined references.

<p>

<p>
Fourth: you must run BibTeX:
<blockquote>
<pre>
bibtex myfile
</pre>
</blockquote>
Don&rsquo;t try to tell BibTeX anything but the file name: say
<tt>bibtex myfile.aux</tt> (because you know it&rsquo;s going to read the
<code class="extension">aux</code> file) and BibTeX will blindly attempt to process
<tt>myfile.aux.aux</tt>.

<p>
BibTeX will scan the <code class="extension">aux</code> file; it will find which bibliography
style it needs to use, and will &ldquo;compile&rdquo; that style; it will note
the citations; it will find which bibliography files it needs, and
will run through them matching citations to entries in the
bibliography; and finally it will sort the entries that have been
cited (if the bibliography style specifies that they should be
sorted), and outputs the resulting details to a <code class="extension">bbl</code> file.

<p>
Fifth: you run LaTeX again.  It warns, again, that each citation is
(still) undefined, but when it gets to the <code>&#x5c;bibliography</code> command,
it finds a <code class="extension">bbl</code> file, and reads it.  As it encounters each
<code>&#x5c;bibitem</code> command in the file, it notes a definition of the
citation.

<p>
Sixth: you run LaTeX yet again.  This time, it finds values for all
the citations, in its <code class="extension">aux</code> file.  Other things being equal, you&rsquo;re
done&hellip; until you change the file.

<p>
If, while editing, you change any of the citations, or add new ones,
you need to go through the process above from steps 3 (first run of
LaTeX) to 6, again, before the document is once again stable.
These four mandatory runs of LaTeX make processing a document with
a bibliography even more tiresome than the normal two runs required to
resolve labels.

<p>
To summarise: processing to resolve citations requires: LaTeX;
BibTeX; LaTeX; LaTeX.
