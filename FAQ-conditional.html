<p>

<p>
While LaTeX (or any other TeX-derived package) isn&rsquo;t really like a
compiler, people regularly want to do compiler-like things using it.
Common requirements are conditional &lsquo;compilation&rsquo; and &lsquo;block
comments&rsquo;, and several LaTeX-specific means to this end are available.

<p>
The simple <code>&#x5c;newcommand</code><code>&#x7b;<code>&#x5c;gobble</code>&#x7d;</code>[1]<tt>&#x7b;&#x7d;</tt> 
and <code>&#x5c;iffalse</code><tt> ... </tt><code>&#x5c;fi</code> aren&rsquo;t really satisfactory (as
a general solution) for comments, since the matter being skipped is
nevertheless scanned by TeX, not always as you would expect.  The
scanning imposes restrictions on what you&rsquo;re allowed to skip; this may
not be a problem in <em>today&rsquo;s</em> job, but could return to bite you
tomorrow.  For an example of surprises that may come to bite you,
consider the following example (derived from real user experience):
<blockquote>
<pre>
\iffalse % ignoring this bit
consider what happens if we
use \verb+\iftrue+ -- a surprise
\fi
</pre>
</blockquote>
The <code>&#x5c;iftrue</code> is spotted by TeX as it scans, ignoring the
<code>&#x5c;verb</code> command; so the <code>&#x5c;iffalse</code> isn&rsquo;t terminated by the
following <code>&#x5c;fi</code>.  Also, <code>&#x5c;gobble</code> is pretty inefficient at
consuming anything non-trivial, since all the matter to be skipped is
copied to the argument stack before being ignored.

<p>
If your requirement is for a document from which whole chapters (or
the like) are missing, consider the LaTeX
<code>&#x5c;include</code>/<code>&#x5c;includeonly</code> system.  If you &lsquo;<code>&#x5c;include</code>&rsquo; your
files (rather than <code>&#x5c;input</code> them&nbsp;&mdash; see 
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-include.html">What&rsquo;s going on in my <code>&#x5c;include</code> commands?</a>),
LaTeX writes macro traces of what&rsquo;s going on at the end of each
chapter to the <code class="extension">aux</code> file; by using <code>&#x5c;includeonly</code>, you can give
LaTeX an exhaustive list of the files that are needed.  Files that
don&rsquo;t get <code>&#x5c;include</code>d are skipped entirely, but the document
processing continues as if they <em>were</em> there, and page, footnote,
and other numbers are not disturbed.  Note that you can choose which
sections you want included interactively, using the
<i class="package">askinclude</i> package.

<p>
A variant on the <code>&#x5c;includeonly</code> mechanism is offered by the
<i class="package">stampinclude</i> package, which takes advantage of the PDFTeX
<code>&#x5c;pdffilemoddate</code> command.  When an <code>&#x5c;include</code>d file is
processed in a LaTeX document, an <code class="extension">aux</code> file is created
holding data such as page-number ranges and chapter/section numbers.
When <code>&#x5c;stampinclude</code> is included in a document, it compares the
file system modification times for each file and its corresponding
<code class="extension">aux</code> file; the file is only compiled in &ldquo;this run&rdquo; of the
document if the file is newer than its corresponding <code class="extension">aux</code>
file.  The package requires a current PDFTeX, and will also run on
LuaTeX if the <i class="package">pdftexcmds</i> package is available
(<i class="package">pdftexcmds</i> emulates the requisite PDFTeX commands using
<tt>lua</tt>.  Apart from this requirement, <i class="package">stampinclude</i> is
a low-maintenace object; include it in your document and it silently
does its job.  When you want a final version of your document, delete
all the <code class="extension">aux</code> files, and and <i class="package">stampinclude</i> won&rsquo;t
interfere.)

<p>
The inverse can be done using the <i class="package">excludeonly</i> package: this
allows you to exclude a (list of) <code>&#x5c;include</code>d files from your
document, by means of an <code>&#x5c;excludeonly</code> command.

<p>
If you want to select particular pages of your document, use Heiko
Oberdiek&rsquo;s <i class="package">pagesel</i> or the <i class="package">selectp</i> packages.  You
can do something similar with an existing PDF document (which
you may have compiled using <i class="progname">pdflatex</i> in the first place),
using the <i class="package">pdfpages</i> package.  The job is then done with a
document looking like:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[final]{pdfpages}
\begin{document}
\includepdf[pages=30-40]{yoursource.pdf}
\end{document}
</pre>
</blockquote>
(To include all of the document, you write
<blockquote>
<pre>
\includepdf[pages=-]{yoursource.pdf}
</pre>
</blockquote>
omitting the start and end pages in the optional argument.)

<p>
If you want flexible facilities for including or excluding small
portions of a file, consider the <i class="package">comment</i>, <i class="package">version</i> or
<i class="package">optional</i> packages.

<p>
The <i class="package">comment</i> package allows you to declare areas of a document to be
included or excluded; you make these declarations in the preamble of
your file.  The command <code>&#x5c;includecomment</code><code>&#x7b;version-name&#x7d;</code>
declares an environment <code class="environment">version-name</code> whose content will
be included in your document, while
<code>&#x5c;excludecomment</code><code>&#x7b;version-name&#x7d;</code> defines an environment whose
content will be excluded from the document.  The package uses a method
for exclusion that is pretty robust, and can cope with ill-formed
bunches of text (e.g., with unbalanced braces or <code>&#x5c;if</code> commands).

<p>
(These FAQs employ the <i class="package">comment</i> package to alter layout
between the printed (two-column) version and the PDF version
for browsing; there are <code class="environment">narrowversion</code> and
<code class="environment">wideversion</code> for the two versions of the file.)

<p>
<i class="package">version</i> offers similar facilities to <i class="filename">comment.sty</i>
(i.e., <code>&#x5c;includeversion</code> and <code>&#x5c;excludeversion</code> commands);
it&rsquo;s far &ldquo;lighter weight&rdquo;, but is less robust (and in particular,
cannot deal with very large areas of text being included/excluded).

<p>
A significant development of <i class="package">version</i>, confusingly called
<i class="package">versions</i> (i.e., merely a plural of the old package name).
<i class="package">Versions</i> adds a command
<code>&#x5c;markversion</code><code>&#x7b;version-name&#x7d;</code> which defines an environment
that prints the included text, with a clear printed mark around it.

<p>
<i class="package">optional</i> defines a command <code>&#x5c;opt</code>; its first argument is
an &lsquo;inclusion flag&rsquo;, and its second is text to be included or
excluded.  Text to be included or excluded must be well-formed
(nothing mismatched), and should not be too big&nbsp;&mdash; if a large body of
text is needed, <code>&#x5c;input</code> should be used in the argument.
The documentation (in the package file itself) tells you
how to declare which sections are to be included: this can be done in
the document preamble, but the documentation also suggests ways in
which it can be done on the command line that invokes LaTeX, or
interactively.

<p>
And, not least of this style of conditional compilation,
<i class="package">verbatim</i> (which should be available in any distribution)
defines a <code class="environment">comment</code> environment, which enables the
dedicated user of the source text editor to suppress bits of a
LaTeX source file.  The <i class="class">memoir</i> class offers the same
environment.

<p>
An interesting variation is the <i class="package">xcomment</i> package.  This
defines an environment whose body is all excluded, apart from
environments named in its argument.  So, for example:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{xcomment}{figure,table}
  This text is not included
  \begin{figure}
    This figure is included
  \end{figure}
  This is not included, either
  \begin{table}
    This table also included
  \end{table}
  ...
\end{xcomment}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i class="package">tagging</i> package offers another neat set of syntax, which
allow the user to apply &ldquo;tags&rdquo; to chunks of text, and to include and
exclude tagged text, according to the tags.  For example, the user may
&lsquo;use&rsquo; text marked with some tags, and to &lsquo;drop&rsquo; marked with others:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usetag{<tag list>}
\droptag{<tag list>}
</pre>
</blockquote>
(the tag lists consist of comma-separated single words).

<p>
There are then commands
<blockquote>
<pre>
\tagged{<tag list>}{<text>}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which reproduces the text only if the &lsaquo;<i>tag list</i>&rsaquo; contains at
least one tag listed in the <code>&#x5c;usetag</code> comand, and
<blockquote>
<pre>
\untagged{<tag list>}{<text>}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which only reproduces the text unless the &lsaquo;<i>tag list</i>&rsaquo; contains
none of the tags mention in the <code>&#x5c;droptag</code> command.

<p>
Further commands offer an if-then-else setup, and specify
<code class="environment">taggedblock</code> and <code class="environment">untaggedblock</code> environments
that.

<p>
Another valuable aspect of the problem is covered by the
<i class="package">extract</i> package.  The package allows you to produce a
&ldquo;partial copy&rdquo; of an existing document: 
the package was developed to permit production of a &ldquo;book of
examples&rdquo; from a set of lecture notes.  The package documentation
shows the following usage:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage[
  active,
  generate=foobar,
  extract-env={figure,table},
  extract-cmd={chapter,section}
]{extract}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which will cause the package to produce a file <i class="filename">foobar.tex</i>
containing all the <code class="environment">figure</code> and <code class="environment">table</code>
environments, and the <code>&#x5c;chapter</code> and <code>&#x5c;section</code> commands, from
the document being processed.  The new file <i class="filename">foobar.tex</i> is
generated in the course of an otherwise ordinary run on the &lsquo;master&rsquo;
document.  The package provides a good number of other facilities,
including (numeric or labelled) ranges of environments to extract, and
an <code class="environment">extract</code> environment which you can use to create complete
ready-to-run LaTeX documents with stuff you&rsquo;ve extracted.
