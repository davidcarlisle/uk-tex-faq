<h1>Breaking boxes of text</h1>


<p>

<p>
(La)TeX boxes may not be broken, in ordinary usage: once you&rsquo;ve
typeset something into a box, it will stay there, and the box will jut
out beyond the side or the bottom of the page if it doesn&rsquo;t fit in the
typeset area.

<p>
If you want a substantial portion of your text to be framed (or
coloured), the restriction imposes a serious restriction.
Fortunately, there are ways around the problem.

<p>
The <i class="package">framed</i> package provides <code class="environment">framed</code> and
<code class="environment">shaded</code> environments; both put their content into
something which looks like a framed (or coloured) box, but which
breaks as necessary at page end.  The environments &ldquo;lose&rdquo; footnotes,
marginpars and head-line entries, and will not work with
<i class="package">multicol</i> or other column-balancing macros.  The
<i class="class">memoir</i> class includes the functionality of the
<i class="package">framed</i> package.

<p>
The <i class="package">mdframed</i> package does the same job, using a different
algorithm.  The package also provides means of defining
&lsquo;private&rsquo; framed environments, whose parameters are set at definition
time, thus saving considerable effort in documents with many framed
boxes.  Its restrictions seem much the same as those of
<i class="package">framed</i>; this is as one would expect, but the list is
noticeably different in the two packages&rsquo; documentation.

<p>
The <i class="package">boites</i> package provides a <code class="environment">breakbox</code>
environment; examples of its use may be found in the distribution, and
the package&rsquo;s <i class="filename">README</i> file contains terse documentation.  The
environments may be nested, and may appear inside
<code class="environment">multicols</code> environments; however, floats, footnotes and
marginpars will be lost.

<p>
For Plain TeX users, the facilities of the <i class="package">backgrnd</i>
package may be useful; this package subverts the output routine to
provide vertical bars to mark text, and the macros are clearly marked
to show where coloured backgrounds may be introduced (this requires
<i class="package">shade</i>, which is distributed as tex macros and
device-independent MetaFont for the shading).  The author of
<i class="package">backgrnd</i> claims that the package works with LaTeX 2.09, but
there are reasons to suspect that it may be unstable working with
current LaTeX.
