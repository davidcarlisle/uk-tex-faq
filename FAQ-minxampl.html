<p>

<p>
<a class="FAQuestion.html" href="FAQ-askquestion.html">Our advice on asking questions</a>
suggests that you prepare a &ldquo;minimum example&rdquo; (also commonly known
as a &ldquo;<em>minimal</em> example&rdquo;) of failing behaviour,
as a sample to post with your question.  If you have a problem in a
two hundred page document, it may be unclear how to proceed from this
problem to a succinct demonstration of your problem.

<p>
There are two valid approaches to this task: building up, and hacking
down.

<p>

<b><em>Building up</em></b> starts
with a basic document structure
(for LaTeX, this would have <code>&#x5c;documentclass</code>,
<code>&#x5c;begin</code><code>&#x7b;document&#x7d;</code>, <code>&#x5c;end</code><code>&#x7b;document&#x7d;</code>) and adds
things.  First to add is a paragraph or so around the actual point
where the problem occurs.  (It may prove difficult to find the actual
line that&rsquo;s provoking the problem.  If the original problem is an
error, reviewing 
<a class="FAthe answer to question.html" href="FAQ-errstruct.html">&ldquo;the structure of TeX errors&rdquo;</a>
may help.)

<p>
Note that there are things that can go wrong in one part of the
document as a result of something in another part: the commonest is
problems in the table of contents (from something in a section title,
or whatever), or the list of &lsaquo;<i>something</i>&rsaquo; (from something in a
<code>&#x5c;caption</code>).  In such a case, include the section title or caption
(the caption probably needs the <code class="environment">figure</code> or
<code class="environment">table</code> environment around it, but it <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> need
the figure or table itself).

<p>
If this file you&rsquo;ve built up shows the problem already, then you&rsquo;re done.
Otherwise, try adding packages; the optimum is a file with only one
package in it, but you may find that the guilty package won&rsquo;t even load
properly unless another package has been loaded.  (Another common case
is that package <i class="package">A</i> only fails when package <i class="package">B</i> has been
loaded.)

<p>

<b><em>Hacking down</em></b> starts
with your entire document, and
removes bits until the file no longer fails (and then of course
restores the last thing removed).  Don&rsquo;t forget to hack out any
unnecessary packages, but mostly, the difficulty is choosing what to
hack out of the body of the document; this is the mirror of the
problem above, in the &ldquo;building up&rdquo; route.

<p>
If you&rsquo;ve added a package (or more than one), add <code>&#x5c;listfiles</code> to
the preamble too: that way, LaTeX will produce a list of the
packages you&rsquo;ve used and their version numbers.  This information may
be useful evidence for people trying to help you.

<p>
The process of &lsquo;building up&rsquo;, and to some extent that of &lsquo;hacking
down&rsquo;, can be helped by stuff available on CTAN:
<ul>
<li> the <i class="class">minimal</i> class (part of the LaTeX distribution)
  does what its name says: it provides nothing more than what is
  needed to get LaTeX code going, and
<li> the <i class="package">mwe</i> bundle provides a number of images in formats
  that (La)TeX documents can use, and a small package <i class="package">mwe</i>
  which loads other useful packages (such as <i class="package">blindtext</i> and
  <i class="package">lipsum</i>, both capable of producing dummy text in a
  document).
</ul>

<p>
What if none of of these cut-down derivatives of your document will
show your error?  Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t post the whole of the document: if
you can, it may be useful to make a copy available on the web
somewhere: people will probably understand if it&rsquo;s impossible&nbsp;&hellip; 
or inadvisable, in the case of something confidential.

<p>
If the whole document is indeed necessary, it could be that your
error is an overflow of some sort; the best you can do is to post the
code &ldquo;around&rdquo; the error, and (of course) the full text of the error.

<p>
It may seem that all this work is rather excessive for preparing a
simple post.  There are two responses to that, both based on the
relative inefficiency of asking a question on the internet.

<p>
First, preparing a minimum document very often leads <em>you</em> to the
answer, without all the fuss of posting and looking for responses.

<p>
Second, your prime aim is to get an answer as quickly as possible; a
well-prepared example stands a good chance of attracting an answer
&ldquo;in a single pass&rdquo;: if the person replying to your post finds she
needs more information, you have to find that request, post again, and
wait for your benefactor to produce a second response.

<p>
All things considered, a good example file can save you a day, for
perhaps half an hour&rsquo;s effort invested.
