<h1>Replacing the BibTeX&ndash;LaTeX mechanism</h1>


<p>

<p>
Producing a successor to BibTeX has long been a favoured activity
among a certain class of TeX-users; the author has seen reports of
progress (on several projects), over the years, but few that claim to
be ready for &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; use.

<p>
Few would deny that BibTeX is ripe for renewal: as originally
conceived, it was a program for creating bibliographies for technical
documents, in English.  People have contributed mechanisms for a
degree of multilingual use (whose techniques are arcane, and quite
likely inextensible), while an extension (<i class="progname">bibtex8</i>) allows
use with 8-bit character codes, thus providing some multilingual
capabilities.  In addition, specialist BibTeX style files are
available for use in non-technical papers.

<p>
BibTeX uses a style language whose mechanisms are unfamiliar to
most current programmers: it&rsquo;s difficult to learn, but since there are
few opportunities to write the language, it&rsquo;s also difficult to become
fluent (in the way that so many people fluently write the equally
arcane TeX macro language).

<p>
Oren Patashnik (the author of BibTeX) summarises the issues as he
sees them, in a 
<a href="http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb24-1/patashnik.pdf.html">TUG conference paper from 2003</a>
that seems to suggest that we might expect a
BibTeX&nbsp;1.0 &hellip; which hasn&rsquo;t (yet) appeared.

<p>
In the absence of BibTeX&nbsp;1.0, what do we need from the bibliography
system of the future?&nbsp;&mdash; simple: a superset of what BibTeX does
(or can be made to do), preferably implementing a simpler style
language, and with coherent multilingual capabilities.

<p>
There are two parts to a bibliography system; processing the database
of citations, and typesetting the results.  The existing BibTeX
system provides a means of processing the database, and there are
macros built into LaTeX, as well as many LaTeX packages, that
process the results.

<p>
Of the direct BibTeX replacements, only two have been submitted to
CTAN: CrossTeX and <i class="progname">biber</i>.

<p>
CrossTeX&rsquo;s language feels familiar to the existing user of
BibTeX, but it&rsquo;s redesigned in an object-oriented style, and looks
(to a non-user) as if it may well be adequately flexible.  It is said
to operate as a BibTeX replacement.

<p>
CrossTeX&rsquo;s team respond to queries, and seem well aware of the
need for multilingual support, though it isn&rsquo;t currently offered.

<p>
<i class="progname">Biber</i> is intimately associated with the LaTeX package
<i class="package">biblatex</i>; it is logically a BibTeX replacement, but is also
capable of using bibliography databases in its own
<i class="progname">biblatexml</i> (XML-based) format.  <i class="package">Biblatex</i>
can also use BibTeX, but <i class="progname">biber</i> opens up a far wider
range of possibilities, including full Unicode support.

<p>
<i class="package">Biblatex</i> is a processor for the output of an application
such as <i class="progname">biber</i> or BibTeX; the style of citations and of
the bibliography itself (in your document) is determined by the way
your <i class="package">biblatex</i> style has been set up, not on some
BibTeX-LaTeX package combination.  <i class="package">Biblatex</i>&rsquo;s
structure thus eliminates the collections of BibTeX styles, at a
stroke; it comes with a basic set of styles, and details are
determined by options, set at package loading time.  The author,
Philipp Lehman, evaluated the whole field of bibliography software
before starting, and as a result the package provides answers to
many of the questions asked in the bibliography sections of these
FAQs.

<p>
<i class="package">Biblatex</i> was released as experimental software, but it&rsquo;s
clear that many users are already using it happily; Lehman is
responsive to problem reports, at the moment, but a <em>de facto</em>
set of expert users is already establishing itself.  A set of
contributed styles has appeared, which cover some of the trickier
bibliography styles.  The road map of the project shows that we are
now working on the final <em>beta</em> releases before the &ldquo;stable&rdquo;
<i class="package">biblatex</i>&nbsp;1.0.

<p>
Finally, <i class="package">Amsrefs</i> uses a transformed <code class="extension">bib</code> file,
which is expressed as LaTeX macros.  (The package provides a
BibTeX style that performs the transformation, so that a LaTeX
source containing a <code>&#x5c;nocite</code><code>&#x7b;*&#x7d;</code> command enables BibTeX to
produce a usable <i class="package">amsrefs</i> bibliography database.)

<p>
<i class="package">Amsrefs</i> is maintained by the AMS as part of its author
support programme,
