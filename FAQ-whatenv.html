<h1>What are LaTeX &ldquo;environments&rdquo;</h1>


<p>

<p>
While TeX makes direct provision for commands, LaTeX adds a
concept of &ldquo;environment&rdquo;; environments perform an action on a block
(of something or other) rather than than just doing something at one
place in your document.

<p>
A totally trivial environment could change the font in use for a chunk
of text, as
<blockquote>
<pre>
\newenvironment{monoblock}%
  {\ttfamily}%
  {}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which defines a <code class="environment">monoblock</code> which may be used as
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{monoblock}
  some text set in monospace
\end{monoblock}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which will look like:
<blockquote>
  <tt>some text set in monospace</tt>
</blockquote>
so it is a particularly simple example.  A rather complicated
environment is introduced by <code>&#x5c;begin</code><code>&#x7b;document&#x7d;</code>; it looks
simple, but needs all sorts of special TeX code to make it work
&lsquo;transparently&rsquo;; most environments are more elaborate than
<code class="environment">monoblock</code> and <em>much</em> simpler than
<code class="environment">document</code>.

<p>
An environment puts its content inside a TeX <em>group</em>, so that
commands used inside the environment don&rsquo;t &lsquo;leak out&rsquo;&nbsp;&mdash; the
<code class="environment">monoblock</code> environment, above, restricts its effect to
its own contents (the stuff between the <code>&#x5c;begin</code><code>&#x7b;monoblock&#x7d;</code>
and <code>&#x5c;end</code><code>&#x7b;monoblock&#x7d;</code>), which is just what you need for this
sort of thing.

<p>
So that&rsquo;s &ldquo;simple&rdquo; environments; the <code class="environment">monoblock</code>, above
doesn&rsquo;t actually gain us much over
<blockquote>
<pre>
{\ttfamily some text set in monospace}
</pre>
</blockquote>
though in fact many useful environments are just as simple (to look
at).  Some, such as <code class="environment">verbatim</code>, look simple but are
actually very tricky inside.

<p>
LaTeX also allows arguments to an environment:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\newenvironment{fontblock}[1]%
  {#1\selectfont}%
  {}
</pre>
</blockquote>
and use of <code class="environment">fontblock</code> as:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{fontblock}{\ttfamily}
</pre>
</blockquote>
would produce the same effect as the <code class="environment">monoblock</code>
environment.

<p>
Environments may also have optional arguments, in much the same way as
commands:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\newenvironment{normaltext}[1][\itshape]%
  {#1}%
  {}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which will ordinarily set its body in italic, but
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{normaltext}[\ttfamily]
  ...
\end{normaltext}
</pre>
</blockquote>
will observe its optional argument, and behave the same as the
<code class="environment">monoblock</code> we started with.

<p>
Note that an environments argument(s) (mandatory or optional) are
<em>not</em> passed to the &lsquo;<code>&#x5c;end</code>&rsquo; text of the environment&nbsp;&mdash; that
is specified as a macro with no arguments, so that
<blockquote>
<pre>
\newenvironment{normaltext}[1][\itshape]%
  {#1}%
  {\typeout{what was #1, again?}
</pre>
</blockquote>
produces an error message
<blockquote>
<pre>
! Illegal parameter number in definition of \endnormaltext.
</pre>
</blockquote>
So, if you need to pass an environment argument to the end-code, you
have to wrap it in a macro of its own:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\newenvironment{normaltext}[1][Intro]%
  {#1%
   \newcommand{\foo}{#1}}%
  {\typeout{what was \foo{}, again?}
</pre>
</blockquote>
