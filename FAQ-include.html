<p>

<p>
The original LaTeX provided the <code>&#x5c;include</code> command to address the
problem of long documents: with the relatively slow computers of the
time, the companion <code>&#x5c;includeonly</code> facility was a boon.  With the
vast increase in computer speed, <code>&#x5c;includeonly</code> is less valuable
(though it still has its place in some very large projects).
Nevertheless, the facility is retained in current LaTeX, and causes
some confusion to those who misunderstand it.

<p>
In order for <code>&#x5c;includeonly</code> to work, <code>&#x5c;include</code> makes a separate
<code class="extension">aux</code> file for each included file, and makes a &lsquo;checkpoint&rsquo; of
important parameters (such as page, figure, table and footnote
numbers).  As a direct result, it <em>must</em> clear the current page
both before and after the <code>&#x5c;include</code> command.  (The requirement
derives from the difficulties of 

  <a href="FAQ-wrongpn.html">observing page numbers</a>.)




What&rsquo;s more, this mechanism doesn&rsquo;t work if a <code>&#x5c;include</code> command
appears in a file that was <code>&#x5c;include</code>d itself: LaTeX diagnoses
this as an error.

<p>
So, we can now answer the two commonest questions about <code>&#x5c;include</code>:
<ul>
<li> Why does LaTeX throw a page before and after <code>&#x5c;include</code>
  commands?

<p>
  Answer: because it has to.  If you don&rsquo;t like it, replace the
  <code>&#x5c;include</code> command with <code>&#x5c;input</code>&nbsp;&mdash; you won&rsquo;t be able to use
  <code>&#x5c;includeonly</code> any more, but you probably don&rsquo;t need it anyway, so
  don&rsquo;t worry.


<p>

<li> Why can&rsquo;t I nest <code>&#x5c;include</code>d files?&nbsp;&mdash; I always used to be
  able to under LaTeX 2.09.

<p>
  Answer: in fact, you couldn&rsquo;t, even under LaTeX 2.09, but the failure
  wasn&rsquo;t diagnosed.  However, since you were happy with the behaviour
  under LaTeX 2.09, replace the <code>&#x5c;include</code> commands with <code>&#x5c;input</code>
  commands (with <code>&#x5c;clearpage</code> as appropriate).
</ul>
