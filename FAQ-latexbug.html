<h1>Reporting a LaTeX bug</h1>

<p>
The LaTeX team supports LaTeX, and will deal with

<em>bona fide</em> bug reports.  Note that the LaTeX team does
<em>not</em> deal with contributed packages&nbsp;&mdash; just the software that
is part of the LaTeX distribution itself: LaTeX and the
&ldquo;required&rdquo; packages.
Furthermore, you need to be slightly
careful to produce a bug report that is usable by the team.  The steps
are:

<p>
<b>1.</b> Are you still using current LaTeX?  Maintenance is only
available for sufficiently up-to-date versions of LaTeX&nbsp;&mdash; if your
LaTeX is more than two versions out of date, the bug reporting
mechanisms may reject your report.

<p>
<b>2.</b> Has your bug already been reported?  Browse the

<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html?introduction=yes.html">LaTeX bugs database</a>,
to find any earlier instance of your bug.  In many cases, the database
will list a work-around.

<p>
<b>3.</b> Prepare a 
<a href="FAQ-minxampl.html">&ldquo;minimum&rdquo; file</a> that exhibits the problem.
Ideally, such a file should contain no contributed packages&nbsp;&mdash; the
LaTeX team as a whole takes no responsibility for such packages (if
they&rsquo;re supported at all, they&rsquo;re supported by their authors).  The
&ldquo;minimum&rdquo; file should be self-sufficient: if a member of the team
runs it in a clean directory, on a system with no contributed
packages, it should replicate your problem.

<p>
<b>4.</b> Run your file through LaTeX: the bug
system needs the <code class="extension">log</code> file that this process creates.

<p>
<b>5.</b> Connect to the 
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/bugs-upload.html.html">latex bugs processing web page</a>
and enter details of your bug&nbsp;&mdash; category, summary and full
description, and the two important files (source and log file).

<p>
The personal details are <em>not</em> optional: the members of the
LaTeX team may need to contact to discuss the bug with you, or to
advise you of a work-around.  Your details will not appear in the
public view of the database.
