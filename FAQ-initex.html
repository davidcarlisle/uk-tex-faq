<h1>What&rsquo;s happened to <i class="progname">initex</i>?</h1>


<p>

<p>
In the beginning, (La)TeX was stretching the capacity of every
system it was ported to, so there was a premium on reducing the size
of executables.  One way of doing this was to have a separate
executable, <i class="progname">initex</i>, that had things in it that aren&rsquo;t
needed in ordinary document runs&nbsp;&mdash; notably <code>&#x5c;patterns</code> (which
builds hyphenation tables), and <code>&#x5c;dump</code> (which writes out a format).

<p>
On modern systems, the size of this code is insignificant in
comparison to the memory available, and maintaining separate programs
has been found sufficiently error-prone that free Unix-style system
distributions have abolished <i class="progname">initex</i> and its friends and
relations such as <i class="progname">inipdftex</i> in favour of a single
executable (that is, just <i class="progname">tex</i> or <i class="progname">pdftex</i>) that
will &ldquo;do what <i class="progname">initex</i> (or whatever) used to do&rdquo; if it
detects the command option &ldquo;<tt>-ini</tt>&rdquo;.

<p>
The change happened with the advent of teTeX version
3.0, which appeared at the beginning of 2005.  At that time,
texlive was following teTeX, so that year&rsquo;s texlive
distribution would also have dropped <i class="progname">initex</i>.

<p>
It would appear that the equation is somewhat different for the
MiKTeX developers, since that system continues to offer an
<i class="progname">initex</i> executable.
