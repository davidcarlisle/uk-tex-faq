<h1>Learning to write LaTeX classes and packages</h1>


<p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s nothing particularly magic about the commands you use when
writing a package, so you can simply bundle up a set of LaTeX
<code>&#x5c;(re)newcommand</code> and <code>&#x5c;(re)newenvironment</code> commands, put them in
a file <i class="filename">package.sty</i> and you have a package.

<p>
However, any but the most trivial package will require rather more
sophistication.  Some details of LaTeX commands for the job are to
be found in &lsquo;LaTeX 2e for class and package writers&rsquo;
(<i class="filename">clsguide</i>, part of the LaTeX documentation distribution).
Beyond this, a good knowledge of TeX itself is valuable: thus books
such as the <a href="FAQ-tex-books.html">TeXbook</a> or 
<a href="FAQ-ol-books.html">TeX by topic</a> are relevant.  With good TeX
knowledge it is possible to use the documented source of LaTeX as
reference material (dedicated authors will acquaint themselves with the
source as a matter of course).  A complete set of the documented
source of LaTeX may be prepared by processing the file
<i class="filename">source2e.tex</i> in the LaTeX distribution.  Such processing is
noticeably tedious, but Heiko Oberdiek has prepared a well-linked
PDF version, which is in the file <i class="filename">base.tds.zip</i> of his
<i class="progname">latex-tds</i> distribution.  Individual files in the LaTeX
distribution may be processed separately with LaTeX, like any
well-constructed <a href="FAQ-dtx.html"><code class="extension">dtx</code> file</a>.

<p>
Writing good classes is not easy; it&rsquo;s a good idea to read some
established ones (<i class="filename">classes.dtx</i>, for example, is the documented
source of the standard classes other than <i class="class">Letter</i>, and may
itself be formatted with LaTeX).  Classes that are not part of the
distribution are commonly based on ones that are, and start by loading
the standard class with <code>&#x5c;LoadClass</code>&nbsp;&mdash; an example of this
technique may be seen in <i class="package">ltxguide.cls</i>

<p>
An 
<a href="http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb28-1/tb88flynn.pdf">annotated version of <i class="class">article</i></a>,
as it appears in <i class="filename">classes.dtx</i>, was published in
TUGboat 28(1).  The article, by Peter Flynn, is a good guide to
understanding <i class="filename">classes.dtx</i>
