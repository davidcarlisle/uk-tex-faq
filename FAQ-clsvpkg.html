<h1>What are LaTeX classes and packages?</h1>


<p>

<p>
LaTeX aims to be a general-purpose document processor.  Such an aim
could be achieved by a selection of instructions which would enable
users to use TeX primitives, but such a procedure is considered too
inflexible (and probably too daunting for ordinary users).  Thus the
designers of LaTeX created a model which offered an
<em>abstraction</em> of the design of documents.  Obviously, not all
documents can look the same (even with the defocussed eye of
abstraction), so the model uses <em>classes</em> of document.  Base
LaTeX offers five classes of document: <i class="class">book</i>,
<i class="class">report</i>, <i class="class">article</i> and <i class="class">letter</i>.
For each class, LaTeX provides a <em>class file</em>; the user
arranges to use it via a <code>&#x5c;documentclass</code> command at the top of the
document.  So a document starting
<blockquote>
  <code>&#x5c;documentclass</code><code>&#x7b;article&#x7d;</code>
</blockquote>
may be called &ldquo;an <em>article</em> document&rdquo;.

<p>
This is a good scheme, but it has a glaring flaw: the actual
typographical designs provided by the LaTeX class files aren&rsquo;t
widely liked.  The way around this is to <em>refine</em> the class.  To
refine a class, a programmer may write a new class file that loads an
existing class, and then does its own thing with the document design.

<p>
If the user finds such a refined class, all is well, but if not, the
common way is to load a <em>package</em> (or several).

<p>
The LaTeX distribution, itself, provides rather few package files,
but there are lots of them, by a wide variety of authors, to be found
on the archives.  Several packages are designed just to adjust the
design of a document&nbsp;&mdash; using such packages achieves what the
programmer might have achieved by refining the class.

<p>
Other packages provide new facilities: for example, the
<i class="package">graphics</i> package (actually provided as part of any LaTeX
distribution) allows the user to load externally-provided graphics
into a document, and the <i class="package">hyperref</i> package enables the user
to construct hyper-references within a document.

<p>
On disc, class and package files only appear different by virtue of
their name &ldquo;extension&rdquo;&nbsp;&mdash; class files are called <i class="filename">*.cls</i> while
package files are called <i class="filename">*.sty</i>.  Thus we find that the LaTeX
standard <i class="class">article</i> class is represented on disc by a file called
<i class="filename">article.cls</i>, while the <i class="package">hyperref</i> package is
represented on disc by a file called <i class="filename">hyperref.sty</i>.

<p>
The class vs.&nbsp;package distinction was not clear in LaTeX 2.09&nbsp;&mdash;
everything was called a style (&ldquo;document style&rdquo; or &ldquo;document style
option&rdquo;).  It doesn&rsquo;t really matter that the nomenclature has
changed: the important requirement is to understand what other people
are talking about.
