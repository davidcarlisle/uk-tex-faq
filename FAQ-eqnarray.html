<p>

<p>
The environment <code class="environment">eqnarray</code> is attractive for the
occasional user of mathematics in LaTeX documents: it seems to
allow aligned systems of equations.  Indeed it <em>does</em> supply such
things, but it makes a serious mess of spacing.  In the system:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{eqnarray}
  a &amp; = &amp; b + c \\
  x &amp; = &amp; y - z
\end{eqnarray}
</pre>
</blockquote>
the spacing around the &ldquo;=&rdquo; signs is <em>not</em> that defined in the
metrics for the font from which the glyph comes&nbsp;&mdash; it&rsquo;s
<code>&#x5c;arraycolsep</code>, which may be set to some very odd value for reasons
associated with real arrays elsewhere in the document.

<p>
The user is far better served by the AMSLaTeX bundle, which
provides an <code class="environment">align</code> environment, which is designed with
the needs of mathematicians in mind (as opposed to the convenience of
LaTeX programmers).  For this simple case (<code class="environment">align</code> and
other AMSLaTeX alignment environments are capable of far greater
things), code as:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{align}
  a &amp; = b + c \\
  x &amp; = y - z
\end{align}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The matter is discussed in more detail in a 
<a href="http://tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen/madsen.pdf">PracTeX journal paper</a>
by Lars Madsen; Stefan Kottwitz offers a 
<a href="http://texblog.net/latex-archive/maths/eqnarray-align-environment/">TeX blog entry</a>
which includes screen shots of the output, convincingly demonstrating
the problem.
