<h1>Marking changed parts of your document</h1>


<p>

<p>
One often needs clear indications of how a document has changed, but
the commonest technique, &ldquo;change bars&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;revision
bars&rdquo;), requires surprisingly much
trickery of the programmer.  The problem is that TeX &lsquo;proper&rsquo;
doesn&rsquo;t provide the programmer with any information about the
&ldquo;current position&rdquo; from which a putative start- or end-point of a
bar might be calculated.   PDFTeX <em>does</em> provide that
information, but no PDFTeX-based changebar package has been
published, that takes advantage of that.

<p>
The simplest package that offers change bars is Peter Schmitt&rsquo;s
<i class="package">backgrnd.tex</i>; this was written as a Plain TeX application
that patches the output routine, but it appears to work at least on
simple LaTeX documents.  Wise LaTeX users will be alerted by the
information that <i class="package">backgrnd</i> patches their output routine, and
will watch its behaviour very carefully (patching the LaTeX output
routine is not something to undertake lightly&hellip;).

<p>
The longest-established LaTeX-specific solution is the
<i class="package">changebar</i> package,
which uses <code>&#x5c;special</code> commands supplied by the driver you&rsquo;re using.
You need therefore to tell the package which driver to you&rsquo;re using
(in the same way that you need to tell the <i class="package">graphics</i>
package); the list of available drivers is pretty
wide, but does not include <i class="progname">dvipdfm</i>.  The package comes with
a shell script <i class="progname">chbar.sh</i> (for use on Unix machines) that
will compare two documents and generate a third which is marked-up
with <i class="package">changebar</i> macros to highlight changes.

<p>
The shareware <i class="progname">WinEDT</i> editor has a macro that will generate
<i class="package">changebar</i> (or other) macros to show differences from an
earlier version of your file, stored in an <i class="progname">RCS</i>-controlled
repository&nbsp;&mdash; see
<a href="http://www.winedt.org/Macros/LaTeX/RCSdiff.php">http://www.winedt.org/Macros/LaTeX/RCSdiff.php</a>

<p>
The <i class="package">vertbars</i> package uses the techniques of the
<i class="package">lineno</i> package (which it loads, so the <i class="package">lineno</i>
itself must be installed); it&rsquo;s thus the smallest of the packages for
change bar marking, since it leaves all the trickery to another
package.  <i class="package">Vertbars</i> defines a <code class="environment">vertbar</code>
environment to create changebars.

<p>
The <i class="package">framed</i> package is
another that provides bars as a side-effect of other desirable
functionality: its <code class="environment">leftbar</code> environment is simply a
stripped-down frame (note, though, that the environment makes a
separate paragraph of its contents, so it is best used when the
convention is to mark a whole changed paragraph.

<p>
Finally, the <i class="class">memoir</i> class allows marginal editorial comments,
which you can obviously use to delimit areas of changed text.

<p>
An even more comprehensive way to keep track of changes is employed by
some word-processors&nbsp;&mdash; to produce a document that embodies both
&ldquo;old&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo; versions.

<p>
To this end, the package <i class="package">changes</i> allows the user to manually
markup changes of text, such as additions, deletions, or replacements.
Changed text is shown in a different colour; deleted text is crossed
out.  The package allows you to define additional authors and their
associated colour; it also allows you to define a markup for authors
or annotations.  The documentation (very clearly) demonstrates how the
various functions work.

<p>
The <i class="progname">Perl</i> script <i class="progname">latexdiff</i> may also be used to
generate such markup for LaTeX documents; you feed it the two
documents, and it produces a new LaTeX document in which the
changes are very visible.  An example of the output is embedded in the
documentation,



 
  <a href="http://mirrors.ctan.org/support/latexdiff/latexdiff-man.pdf">latexdiff-man.pdf</a>
  (part of the distribution).

A rudimentary revision facility is provided by another
<i class="progname">Perl</i> script, <i class="progname">latexrevise</i>, which accepts or rejects
all changes.  Manual editing of the difference file can be used to 
accept or reject selected changes only.
